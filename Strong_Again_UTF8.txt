Preface
JUST ANOTHER DAY
Imagine waking up after a terrible night’s sleep. You spent the whole night
tossing and turning, your back stiff and sore. The only way to get any rest
is to drape one leg off the side of the bed because your knee is killing you.
Forget about sleep; at this point, rest is the best you can hope for.
You’re restless because you and your wife had a huge argument. You’re too
stubborn to sleep on the couch since you both share the blame. Lying on
your back, you choke on your spit due to acid reflux and can’t stop snoring.
Now your wife is really pissed and tells you to get up and go to the couch.
You grumble, roll over to your side, and try to find some relief.
The day starts like any other: waking up early to hit the gym and train cli-
ents all day. You love working with people, but by the end of the day, your
listening cup is full. You try your best to listen to your wife and would do
anything for your kids, but when is it your time to decompress? The last thing
you want is to come home hoping dinner is ready and the kids are almost
tucked in, only to find chaos.
TODAY WILL BE DIFFERENT
10 | STRONG AGAIN
As you park your car in the garage, you think, Today was a great day at
work. I just need to relax, maybe have a snack, and then go upstairs to wish the
kids goodnight. Instead, you hear your wife yelling and all three kids scream-
ing and crying. Oh, crap … should I just get back in the car and leave? you think.
But you decide to go in. Upon opening the door, one child runs to you cry-
ing, another has peed their pants at the dinner table because they’re mad as
hell for breaking their craft project that was supposed to be fun, and the third
is still playing with toys and hasn’t eaten yet.
You try to ignore the chaos and ask, “How was your day, honey?” You
know the kids were at the park all day, skipped naps, and had gymnastics and
dance late. They probably just got home, and chaos has ensued. This isn’t typ-
ical, but it happens often enough. If you don’t believe it, try having three kids
under five. The kids are in meltdown mode, and now it’s your turn to fight
with your wife. What do you fight about? Who knows. Dane Cook called it
the “nothing fights,” and in today’s world these nothing fights are revolving
around Instagram and comparing your life to others’.
Comparing your lives with other people leads you and your wife to have
nothing fights about moving, schools, how only your kids are terrible, or
“keeping up with the Joneses.” The hill you always die on is “let’s be happy
with what we have and blessed that we have three beautiful children.” The
real issue is presence and parenting. Your argument is always that you need
to be better parents and present for your kids, not worry about the size of
your house, having a pool, or living closer to town.
PUT THE FOCUS BACK ON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
But no, the fight ensues. Your wife is a master at stonewalling. She puts
up a wall, and it’s her way or the highway. You’re a personal trainer and a
master at poking fun at people but making it sound adorable. For example,
when a new client is trying but failing to do a lift, you giggle and say, “It’s
Preface | 11
okay, it’s just because you’re weak.” Or, when a client who always tries to get
her breathing right says “I just can’t catch my breath,” you respond with one
of your favorite lines, “It’s not because you’re out of breath, it’s because you’re
out of shape.” It’s the ultimate burn, but they see the funny side, and she’s
still a client to this day.
Back to the fight. You know how you shouldn’t compare your wife to your
mother? Well, the same goes for comparing your husband’s weight to another
guy’s. Your wife shames you with one of those digs as you step into the shower.
You are still throwing jabs at each other, and she hits you with, “Why are you
getting so fat? Your brother looks way better than you.”
That’s when you start stonewalling her. It’s not good on either end, and
you quickly realize it doesn’t work. You love your wife, and she loves you, but
emotions take over, and the tongue is the wickedest muscle. Like the Book
of James says, it’s the rudder that can change the course. A therapist friend
told you that you both need to be responders, not reactors. This means tak-
ing time to think about your response. You can’t change others, but if you
change yourself, the response you get will be different.
Your wife is a Millennial, and from your experience, they want what
you have but don’t want to work for it. Millennials are an Instagram mar-
keting dream, always comparing lives and feeling inadequate. Your wife
works her butt off with her direct sales company but is easily influenced
by social media and friends. Comparison is the thief of joy and wreaks
havoc on marriage.
So, your wife’s comment stings. You’re always striving to be the best pro-
vider and man you can be and feel a ton of responsibility, which charges
your emotions. It’s the middle of the month, and bills are due in two weeks.
On the way home, you realize it’s garbage day tomorrow, and you need to
mow the lawn. Maybe you can finally trim that shrub or remove some weeds.
Then you walk into a screaming household, see more bills on the counter,
and snap—that’s why the fight started. You pile too much on your plate and
think you can do it all.
12 | STRONG AGAIN
SEGMENT YOUR LIFE AND SET GOALS FOR SUCCESS
No prizes for guessing that was me and my wife I was talking about. As I write
this, I still think I can do it all, but then I wonder why I’m writing this at 45
instead of 25. Well, I have more credibility now with 30 years in fitness, and
I need to commit to helping someone. Just one person is enough. This book
breaks down dieting success week by week, cutting out all the B.S. If I can
commit to writing this, you can commit to your goals, whether it’s a body-
building show or losing weight.
LOOK GOOD NAKED
Most people come to the gym to look good naked (LGN). A client once
told me, “People only get skinny from cancer, a divorce, or a for a wedding.”
How often have you been on a good nutrition plan and heard, “Is something
wrong,” or, “Are you sick?” or the newest rage right now when you are skin-
nier is a simple inquisitive look and the phrase “Ozempic?” These comments
can hold you back. Focusing on yourself might seem selfish, but you can’t
take care of others without taking care of yourself first.
Many people have helped me without realizing it. This book aims to rec-
ognize those few who shaped me, even if they’re not fitness enthusiasts. Just
today, I told an athlete he looked like a young Chris Bumstead. That one
comment can change a young person’s life.
If not now, when? Everyone has a story to tell, and it can always help some-
one. Whether it’s a TED Talk or a fitness coach’s advice, you’re either learn-
ing or reaffirming you’re on the right track.

Introduction
LIFE HAPPENS
In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s all too easy for men to lose touch
with their sense of self. The demands of work, the responsibilities of fam-
ily, and the relentless pursuit of success can leave little room for personal
reflection and self-care. Amidst the chaos of emails, meetings, school runs,
and household chores, we can feel like we’re constantly racing against the
clock, barely keeping our heads above water.
The societal expectation to be the unwavering provider and the rock for
loved ones often adds an immense weight onto our shoulders. We pour our
energy into ensuring everyone around us is taken care of, often at the expense
of our own well-being. This relentless cycle can lead to a sense of emptiness
and disconnection, where the joy and fulfillment we once felt in life seem
to dissipate, replaced by a feeling of being trapped in a monotonous rat race.
Depression can silently creep in as we become more detached from the
things that once brought us happiness. The dreams and passions we had in our
youth are often pushed to the side, overshadowed by the pressing responsibil-
ities of adulthood. It becomes vital, then, to take a step back and reevaluate
our priorities, to carve out time for ourselves, and to reconnect with our inner
strength. Through this journey of self-discovery and self-care, we can regain a
sense of purpose and vitality, ensuring we’re not just surviving, but truly thriving.
14 | STRONG AGAIN
CHILDHOOD HEROES
At 45, I find myself reflecting on a journey that began with a simple fasci-
nation—muscles. As a young man, my superheroes were He-Man, Batman,
and Mr. T. I wanted to feel what it was like to harness the power they dis-
played onscreen. When ThunderCats came on TV, I was captivated by Pan-
thro’s nunchucks. A few years later, when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit
the big screen, I gravitated towards Michelangelo and his nunchucks. My
fascination with martial arts and superheroes really started with Bruce Lee.
Although I grew up with an uncle who introduced us to Chuck Norris, Ste-
ven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, I
knew these stars were all molded by Bruce Lee’s influence.
MENTORS FROM MAGAZINES,
FILMS, AND FAMILY SHAPED ME
As a young boy, I eagerly flipped through muscle and movie star maga-
zines, absorbing every bit of knowledge about lifting weights, nutrition, and
being on the big stage. Those larger-than-life stars were my first mentors, guid-
ing me through the basics of fitness training and sparking a lifelong passion.
My brother and I would practice martial arts behind the garage, away from
Mom’s watchful eyes, trying out new moves we saw on TV. My cousin could
throw the sweetest 360-degree Van Damme-style spinning kick, and at 6’4”,
his legs sounded like helicopter rotors slicing through the air. These mem-
ories fueled my drive to learn more about what my body could do through
fitness. I wanted to do it all—bo staff, nunchucks, katana swords, bouncing
my pecs like Bolo Yeung, doing the splits on chairs. The ’80s and ’90s were
a great time to grow up, and I still carry that passion today.
Finding friends and relatives who shared my interest in training was essential.
Without them even realizing it, they pushed me to break through goals each
week and instilled in me the belief that hard work could achieve anything. My
Introduction | 15
uncles and cousins, five to 10 years older than me, grew up with Rocky, a real
try-hard comeback story. The solidarity and shared goals were key to my suc-
cess, fueling my determination to see results not only in the gym but also in life.
GOALS
Setting small goals is crucial for any success. I love the quote, “How do
you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.” You need to visualize your over-
all goal and then break it down into manageable steps. I remember being 12
years old and measuring my biceps at 12 inches. It was a starting point. My
brother and I would work out in the basement with sand-filled plastic Joe
Weider weights given to us by an uncle. We didn’t know what we were doing,
but Arnold Schwarzenegger’s arms were 22 inches, and he said to do XYZ,
so we did XYZ to the best of our ability. Those magazines featured workouts
from Dorian Yates, Nasser El Sonbaty, and Ronnie Coleman on how to build
bigger arms and a bigger chest.
THE SPARK THAT IGNITED THE FUSE
These were all driving factors for my goal to become a superhero. One
pivotal moment was when my brother picked on me for being uncoordi-
nated. I didn’t like that feeling, and I read in a magazine that lifting weights
helps with coordination. Game, set, match. That was it. Then, aged 15, while
working with my uncle on the farm, he said I could talk big about playing
college ball when my arms got as big as his hands formed in a circle. I spe-
cifically remember playing college football at UW-Eau Claire and my arms
being bigger than my uncle’s hands formed in a circle. Such watershed mem-
ories gave me the drive to want more and to help others as they helped me.
On reflection, it was a great time to grow up. Pictures in magazines were
16 | STRONG AGAIN
the only way to see how to do easy and functional lifts. There were no videos
for weightlifting, only aerobics—and I didn’t want to do what Mom was doing
with Richard Simmons or Jane Fonda. Now, with social media, people are
doing all sorts of nonsensical moves that can either hurt someone or have no
place in a strength or fitness world, and kids buy into it. Why does everyone
grab the cable itself to do triceps kickbacks or pushdowns? Why is everyone
barefoot in the gym? I get that Arnold is seen barefoot in a few pictures, but
I grew up in a strength and conditioning gym with athletes—put your shoes
on! You’ll either end up losing a toe or be spreading fungus around. No one
wants to look at your gross feet. But sure, keep doing those burpee box jumps
while being 75 pounds overweight. If it works for you, great, keep it up, but
I’d rather work on my diet to lose the pounds and not stress my poor joints.
I totally understand the headphones in the gym. There are some creepy
dudes you just don’t want to talk to no matter how hard they try to have a
conversation.
AND SO IT BEGINS
STARTING TO KNOW MY BODY
At 25, I took a significant step by participating in my first bodybuilding show.
My college training partner, Rudy, had just competed and looked amazing.
His posing practice was so intense you could hear small pops from his mus-
cles. Inspired, I decided it was time to “shit or get off the pot.” I sought advice
from my cousin Vinnie, who had just won an AST Sports Science body trans-
formation challenge, and knew I had to do this show because Ronnie Cole-
man, a bodybuilding legend, was the guest poser. Meeting him backstage
was a dream come true.
During this time, I was going through a breakup with my girlfriend while
in graduate school, working as a grad assistant strength and conditioning
coach at North Dakota State University. My schedule was packed, training
Introduction | 17
at 5 am, coaching athletes all day, and attending classes until 10 pm. My girl-
friend, a nurse, wanted to move downtown, but I couldn’t afford it or leave
campus. After some arguments, she decided to move out, and I focused on
my bodybuilding prep.
After she left, I dedicated myself to training. Without distractions like
cell phones, internet, or TV, I learned to focus. My wife says I lack empathy;
but us guys often compartmentalize, and shift focus quickly. We’re good at
not being vulnerable.
STEPPING FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE
For the past 17 years, I have owned and operated my own gym. This, it seems, is
the goal of every personal trainer, and I managed it with hard work and increas-
ing my focus through bodybuilding, martial arts, and kickboxing. I work my tail
off in anything I pursue and when I had my first job after grad school, I realized
I had a lot of time on my hands. I only had to work eight-hour days. As a farm
hand growing up I always joked that only working eight hours was a day off.
With all this time on my hands I tried to write a book that went nowhere.
But, during my first job, I started Tae Kwon Do. I always wanted to be a mar-
tial artist, like the heroes from my childhood. I received my black belt at age
26. My master started his own place in Chicago, and after he left, I wanted to
get into something else. I did kickboxing with Coach Medina in the Milwau-
kee area where I lived. I won the Milwaukee rumble in 2007, and soon after,
Coach came to me to ask if I wanted to start my own gym in his newest box-
ing club located in Hartland, WI. Starting with 400 square feet and a prayer, I
have clients from 20 years ago who still train with me three to four days a week.
AND … ACTION!
The advice I have picked up along the way has helped so much. But
advice, like my thoughts on writing a book, can only take you so far. You
18 | STRONG AGAIN
need action steps. I was forced to expand my gym or change location after
Coach Medina wanted to move. I have been rocking the same facility ever
since. Seventeen years and countless clients later, I am sure all the boys com-
ing through my gym can pop their pecs like Bolo Yeung in Bloodsport. The
great thing about training youngsters from age 11 upwards is how impact-
ful you can be as a coach, and what a great opportunity you have into help-
ing them love the same thing you do every day. Each year I get a new batch
of kids, and it is always a similar make up; but seeing them grow confidently
into young adults is truly rewarding.
CONFIDENCE IS THE KEY!
KEEP PUSHING, KEEP TRYING
The key to any success is building confidence. You may be shitting your-
self thinking about your plan, or starting a business, or weight training in a
different gym, but you have to push forward and keep trying. The only thing
stopping you … is you! I have a quote in my gym from Michael Jordan that
says “I can accept failure … I can’t accept not trying.” Starting my gym was
an eye opener to scraping by, week to week. But I focused like I was doing
another bodybuilding show. I was getting into Olympic lifting, powerlifting,
and strongman training as well as bodybuilding and kickboxing. I think my
plate was full athletically, but I kept my focus clear and present on starting
my gym. It seems like a lot to do training wise, but, as I mentioned, I had
plenty of free time starting out slowly and being persistent.
I always liked training in the early mornings. The last thing I want to do
is train after work when I am tired from a long day. It may work for you, but
my guess is that you are reading this book because it doesn’t. I started train-
ing on Friday mornings in college because I wanted to train but also go out
and party at night. And for me, in college, Friday night started around 5 pm
so I could be in bed by 10 pm at the latest. That way, I could still function
Introduction | 19
the next day and do it all over again on Saturday night. I realized that work-
ing out in the morning made me way more efficient with getting things done
throughout the day. If I bust my butt and grind really hard in the morning,
the rest of the day seems way easier.
IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO CHANGE
Since college and starting my own business, I realized clients come to me for
“happy Glen.” I’m always in a good mood, and that’s expected. When I tried
working out in the afternoon for “optimal” testosterone times, I was groggy
and tired for my 5 am clients. I’ve found that better nutrition means need-
ing fewer hours of sleep because the quality of my sleep improves. I often
debated this with a client who is a sleep study expert. They argued for eight
to 10 hours of sleep for optimal recovery, while I believed reducing inflamma-
tion through diet led to better sleep. Anyone who has worked out with me
and embraced clean eating reports good sleep and feeling refreshed, unlike
during my powerlifting days of eating anything.
Throughout my fitness journey, I’ve always wanted to write a book about
my experiences and lessons learned. Now, I’m motivated to bring this vision
to life. I owe it to that one person who will latch onto this book and do
their first show. I want to be part of their journey, just as many have been
part of mine.
It’s been 12 years since my last bodybuilding show, and after hitting the
stage a few months ago and signing up for another show four months later,
many friends and family have sought my advice on nutrition and fitness. While
I’ve always been eager to help, I realized my reach was limited. This book is
my way of extending my knowledge and experiences to a broader audience.
Join me on this journey. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete, a busy par-
ent, or just starting your fitness adventure, this book is for you. Let’s explore
the power of nutrition, the importance of setting goals, and the resilience
needed to overcome life’s challenges. Together, we can achieve greatness and
inspire others to do the same.
20 | STRONG AGAIN
Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. Let’s make every step
count.
TRUST THE PROCESS
The first chapter of our journey focuses on getting started with the diet, which
I call the “master plan.” This plan is your roadmap to success, and it’s crucial
to stick to it without much deviation. Personally, I prefer plans written on
paper over fitness apps. Fitness apps often provide misleading information,
like telling you that you’ve burned a certain number of calories during your
workout, allowing you to eat that much more. This is misinformation. While
some exercise groups like marathon runners have different calorie needs, for
the scope of this book, let’s focus on getting shredded. If you want to lose
weight and be the best version of yourself, or get shredded, you need to stick
to the plan. Deviating too much so you are constantly striving to get back on
track puts you in the “rat race.” Don’t keep spinning the wheel to nowhere—
let’s stick to it and get jacked.
To illustrate, it was famously reported that Michael Phelps ate 10,000 cal-
ories per day while swimming (Phelps & Abrahamson, 2009). He debunked
that claim in an interview and mentioned eating whatever he wanted, but
having tried to reach 300 pounds for powerlifting, I can tell you there’s no
way he ate 10,000 calories every day. Even with my special milkshakes, one
gallon being 7,200 calories, I couldn’t do that daily. This kind of information
overload can confuse the general population. When fitness apps say, “great
workout, you burned 500 calories,” and deduct that from your daily count,
people think they can eat 500 more calories. Maybe they can, but should
they? What kind of calories? Most people aren’t choosing a protein shake and
vegetables for their extra calories, so it’s not worth it. If you have extra fat, let
the workout help to burn that off instead of just eating more.
STICK TO THE MASTER PLAN, AND GET SHREDDED
Introduction | 21
During my last bodybuilding show, which was four months ago as stated
earlier, my friend Todd followed my plan to the extreme, questioning even non-
fat, plain Greek yogurt and gum because of the sugars. While it might seem
crazy, that’s how you learn and cultivate knowledge for your next show. I’m a
fan of going extreme to learn, then figuring out other options later. When in
doubt, put your all into it. This is how I did my first show. I was nervous and
laser-focused, calling my cousin who had won a bodybuilding contest years
prior, asking, “What else can I do to lose this belly fat?” He said to add a ton of
vegetables. I went from eating no broccoli and cauliflower to 10-12 cups a day.
I only did that for a couple of days because I got so bloated it felt like I lacer-
ated my stomach. And my farts were awful. Egg whites with that much broccoli
is a deadly combination. I stepped back to a few cups of veggies each day and
worked up to 10-12 cups. Another example was a woman I trained who ran mar-
athons and wanted to do a show at age 40. After a few weeks on the nutrition
program, she complained about being bloated. I asked if she had recently intro-
duced a lot of vegetables. She said yes, so I had her cut back, and she felt better.
When we start our diets, we want results NOW! But that’s not how it
works. We need to trust the process and take our time.
MAXIMIZE YOUR EFFORTS
BALANCE
Balancing diet and lifestyle can be challenging due to work, family, stress, and
social influences. Many people struggle to prioritize healthy eating and exer-
cise amidst busy schedules. While this isn’t a problem for me as I work out
early, I’ve gained insights from working with various clients.
The convenience of fast food and pre-packaged meals is appealing when
you are so busy. I’ll help you navigate quick fixes for hunger and snacks. Occa-
sionally indulging in junk food is okay, but doing it all the time leads to poor
results. Garbage in, garbage out.
22 | STRONG AGAIN
Prepping healthy meals can be time-consuming initially, but it gets easier
with practice. Just like training early made my days more efficient, meal prep
becomes faster over time. Stress and tiredness can lead to decision fatigue,
making healthier choices feel burdensome. An easy fix for quick grab-and-
go foods is gas stations. They often have convenient but unhealthy foods,
but I start my diets with gas stations in mind because they are usually the
most frequented places with a small grocery inside. And when do we make
“game time” decisions when it comes to food? When we are driving our kids
everywhere for their sports and activities. We need to rethink our approach
to quick meals. Gas stations also offer healthy options that can easily fit into
our busy schedules. By focusing on consciously choosing healthier alterna-
tives such as beef jerky, almonds, and protein bars, we can avoid the usual
quick foods like chicken tenders, cookies, and a bag of chips.
FAIL TO PLAN; PLAN TO FAIL
It can be hard to find the time to educate yourself about healthy eating
and plan meals, but it’s worth it. Planning starts in the morning or when
you get in your car. Meetings may take priority, but it helps to have healthy
options ready. We’re focusing on you and making the right choices to get fit.
Let’s plan together. Without proper planning, it’s easy to fall back on con-
venient but unhealthy food choices, or worse yet, just skipping meals. I’ve
fallen into this trap myself when not focused on a diet.
PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS
Understanding these challenges can help in finding practical solutions, such as
meal prepping, choosing simpler recipes, and gradually incorporating health-
ier options into your diet. That’s why I don’t suggest drastically changing the
types of food you eat in the first four weeks of my diet plan, unless it’s com-
plete junk. Many middle-aged people with kids tend to skip meals and then
Introduction | 23
overeat at work events or family dinners. Let’s change that mentality through
planning.
Firstly, meal prepping. During my first bodybuilding show, I spent hours
prepping on Sundays. I hated it, but it became essential after my girlfriend left.
I learned that prepping food ahead of time makes everything else easier. You
don’t waste time deciding what to eat or where to eat. Now, I can prep a ton of
hamburger meat or bake chicken quickly. Using all four burners on the stove, I
can brown meat while making noodles for the kids or veggies for dinner. Micro-
waving veggies is also super easy, especially in the last four weeks of the plan.
FIRST, SIMPLIFY
Simplifying recipes is crucial. In my mid-30s, I wanted to write a nutri-
tion book (second attempt) based on the rule of three: Each meal should
have only three core elements—meat, vegetables, and starch. For example,
hamburger, tossed salad, and a dinner roll. You can eat as much as you want,
but only use calorie-free or low-calorie dressings or sauces. Mustard works
on almost anything, and I use Greek yogurt as sour cream and salsa for my
hamburger, with a tortilla instead of bread. The main staple should be three
core elements, with lean protein and vegetables a must.
To gradually incorporate healthier foods, increase your protein intake.
Start with a protein drink or non-fat Greek yogurt mixed with an electro-
lyte powder for taste. Replace your breakfast cereal or oatmeal with a high-
protein food. You’ll feel more energized and less groggy throughout the day.
STRESS
Stress from work or personal life often leads to emotional eating, a common
issue among my clients. When stressed, your body releases cortisol, increasing
appetite and cravings for high-fat, sugary foods. This past weekend I had two
encounters—with a psychiatrist friend at martial arts, and a bodybuilder at
24 | STRONG AGAIN
a family event—and we discussed how anxiety about food choices can spike
cortisol levels, affecting cravings. Funnily enough, they were the ones direct-
ing the conversations, not me.
Emotional eating serves as a coping mechanism for negative emotions like
anxiety, sadness, or frustration. For example, after a stressful day with the kids,
my wife might turn to comfort foods. This temporary relief doesn’t resolve
the underlying stress, leading to weight gain and health issues over time. It’s
crucial to focus on yourself and address these habits.
STRESS SUCKS! WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE,
BUT DON’T MAKE IT YOUR IDENTITY
Stress can also change eating habits, leading to more frequent eating or
loss of appetite. It can cause decision fatigue, making it harder to stick to
healthy eating plans. As Fat Bastard from Austin Powers said, “I eat because I
am unhappy, and I am unhappy because I eat.” This cycle of stress and emo-
tional eating can worsen over time.
Developing healthier coping strategies is essential. Mindfulness, exercise, and
support from friends and family can help. For the first four weeks, we’ll focus
on writing out your plan and sticking to it by setting small, achievable goals.
Among these will be incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine. Pre-
paring meals and having healthy snacks available will also make a big difference.
Exercise is a great stress reducer. The release of endorphins and dopamine
after a workout is amazing. You might not feel like it if you’re stressed, but
just showing up for a workout can help. Invite others to join you, creating
a supportive circle. This will help alleviate stress and develop healthy habits.
SOCIAL EVENTS
Social events with food and drinks, especially in Wisconsin with the ubiqui-
tous cheese and sausage trays, can make sticking to a healthy diet challenging
Introduction | 25
due to peer pressure and the desire to fit in. I started my lifestyle change at
44 by cutting out sugar and focusing on my bodybuilding diet, especially
on weekends. Weekend prep was crucial for me. If food wasn’t prepared and
healthy, I wouldn’t eat it. So, I started packing bigger snacks and realized that
popcorn and pretzels weren’t the enemy.
START WITH THE SMALLEST
THINGS FIRST: NO/LIMITED SUGAR
My first test was a birthday party with an abundance of pizza. Instead
of eating a whole pizza, I filled up on veggies, fruit, and diet sodas to curb
cravings. That summer, I attended several graduations parties of the athletes
I trained as well as a few birthday parties of family and friends. At the fam-
ily potlucks, like we in Wisconsin love to have, I avoided sugary foods and
loaded up on brats, hot dogs, beans, and vegetables. If I was still hungry, I ate
more fruit and veggies.
Following this plan got me super lean. When my bodybuilding show came
around, it was easy to transition by not overeating on weekends. As we all
know, weekends are the hardest to keep your eating and drinking in check.
To keep myself busy on the weekends during the first phase of this program,
I would work all day at our cabin, eat protein bars and meat snacks, and
have a couple of drinks at night. Although this kept me lean, I had to adjust
for the last eight weeks before the show. The first four weeks are about being
healthy and having a protein-first mentality. Don’t eat a bag of popcorn by
itself; have a protein drink or bar first.
Social events can be challenging because they revolve around eating and
drinking. You may feel pressure to indulge to fit in. I usually say, “I have
goals,” which shuts people down. Or say, “I don’t want to be fat anymore,”
and look at them like, Neither should you. If needed, fake a drink with a selt-
zer and a lime. Drinking has never been an issue for me because I don’t like
26 | STRONG AGAIN
feeling crappy in the morning. If you can’t give it up or drastically reduce
your intake for 12 weeks, you need to re-evaluate some things.
PUTTING OTHERS FIRST
Family responsibilities, such as caring for children or elderly parents, can be
overwhelming and leave little time for self-care. This is a sensitive subject.
When caring for elderly parents or grandparents, it can be hard to see them
decline. For example, my diabetic grandma, now immobile, still eats cookies,
bread, and pasta. It frustrates me, but she was a workhorse back in the day,
making everything from scratch and living off the land. While it’s frustrating
to see her decline, she has been eating this way for a long time. Who are we
to change her diet after 90 years of her doing what she wanted, regardless?
But don’t let taking care of others hinder the responsibility you have toward
yourself. Remember, as I stated earlier, if you take care of yourself, you will
be better prepared to take care of someone else.
WHO IS IN CONTROL? YOUR
PARENTS, YOUR KIDS, OR YOU?
When it comes to children and healthy food options, it’s up to you as the
parent. If your kid doesn’t like the food you prepare, they don’t eat. We need to
be disciplined and teach them the difference between a treat and a crappy life-
style. If you have a crappy lifestyle, your kids likely will too. Take ownership and
lead by example. Walk the walk and lead. Do it for your kids’ health and yours.
Caring for children or elderly parents can lead to less healthy eating habits
and poor nutrition. The demands of caregiving can be overwhelming, leaving
little time and energy for meal planning and preparation. This can result in
relying on convenient, processed foods that are quicker to prepare but often
less nutritious. I’m currently caring for my children as they grow and watching
my mom care for her mom almost 24/7. The long days and sleepless nights
Introduction | 27
take a toll on our bodies and our spirits. Grandma had eight kids, and they
are stepping up to help her in her twilight years. My grandma led by exam-
ple and instilled the values of discipline and hard work in her children. These
values have been passed down to me, to lead by example with hard work and
discipline when taking care of your health.
It’s easy for parents to fall into the trap of prioritizing foods that their chil-
dren prefer, such as snacks and fast food, over healthier options. This can lead
to a diet high in sugars and fats but low in essential nutrients. Additionally,
if the children are not finishing their food that you made them, are you? Do
not finish your kids’ food if you are trying to lose weight.
SET GOALS AND SHOW UP TO MEET THEM
Setting realistic goals, tracking progress, and celebrating small victories
can help maintain motivation over the long term. By acknowledging these
challenges and finding practical solutions, you can improve your nutrition
and overall well-being.
EDUCATING YOURSELF
Educating yourself is one of the most powerful ways to improve your fitness
and nutrition. When you take the time to learn about how different foods
and exercises affect your body, you can make informed decisions that align
with your personal goals and needs. You understand the principles of nutri-
tion, the importance of macronutrients and micronutrients, and how to cre-
ate a balanced diet that supports your lifestyle.
LIVE THROUGH IT AND DON’T ASSUME.
THE BEST EDUCATION IN FITNESS IS TO
ACTUALLY REACH YOUR GOAL
28 | STRONG AGAIN
One of the key benefits of educating yourself is the ability to discern
between credible information and misleading claims. With a solid founda-
tion of knowledge, you can critically evaluate the plethora of diet and fitness
advice available, avoiding fads and quick fixes that promise unrealistic results.
This empowers you to adopt sustainable habits that lead to long-term success.
TAKE OWNERSHIP
Moreover, it fosters a sense of ownership and accountability. When you
understand the “why” behind your choices, you’re more likely to stay com-
mitted and motivated. This is often why some people are more successful than
others; they have taken the time to educate themselves and apply that knowl-
edge consistently. They are better equipped to navigate challenges, adjust their
plans as needed, and maintain a positive mindset.
In contrast, those who rely solely on external advice without understand-
ing the underlying principles may struggle to adapt when faced with obsta-
cles. They might follow a plan blindly without knowing how to modify it
to suit their unique circumstances, leading to frustration and eventual aban-
donment of their goals.
Ultimately, educating yourself is about empowering yourself. It gives you
the tools to create a personalized approach that works for you, leading to
greater success and satisfaction in your fitness journey.
HAVE A MASTER PLAN
Having a master plan is a brilliant strategy for starting and maintaining a
diet. By reading nutrition labels and sticking to a consistent meal plan, you
gain a clear understanding of what you’re consuming and how it affects your
body. This approach allows you to make informed decisions and easily swap
out foods with similar nutritional profiles, ensuring that your diet remains
balanced and effective.
Introduction | 29
Planning is the key to success. It helps you stay organized, reduces the stress
of deciding what to eat, and ensures that you always have healthy options avail-
able. Allowing for small deviations in your master plan ensures flexibility, so you
can enjoy variety without straying too far from your goals. When you hit a rut or
face challenges, you can always return to your master plan as a reliable foundation.
This method provides consistency but also empowers you to adjust to
your personal preferences and needs. It’s a sustainable way to approach diet-
ing, making it easier to stick with your plan in the long term.
SEEK PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
It’s understandable to seek nutrition advice from those who have practical,
real-world experience. Below are some ways to learn about nutrition from
individuals who “walk the walk.”
Seek out nutrition experts with a proven track record and personal stories of
resilience. This may include fitness trainers, bodybuilders, and doctors or health
coaches who share their own experiences, not just textbook advice. Avoid follow-
ing social media influencers blindly. Instead, connect with someone at your local
gym and prioritize first-hand experience over second-hand recommendations.
Be cautious of extreme claims about quick fixes or miracle products, as
sustainable health and fitness improvements take time and effort. Diversify-
ing your sources of information by following multiple experts can provide
a more balanced perspective and help you cross-check the validity of any
advice you receive.
Engaging with the community and asking questions can also be help-
ful, as genuine influencers are often willing to provide thoughtful responses.
Ultimately, trust your instincts; if something feels off or too good to be true,
it probably is. By being cautious and critical, you can find influencers who
genuinely want to help and share valuable, practical advice.
SEEK ADVICE, BUT IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO YOU
30 | STRONG AGAIN
One of the best ways to understand what works best for your body and
lifestyle is to give something a go. By experimenting and observing how dif-
ferent foods and routines affect you, you can tailor your diet and fitness plan
to meet your specific needs and goals. It’s also empowering to rely on your
own knowledge and intuition. The journey of learning and self-improvement
is ongoing, especially in the fields of nutrition and fitness. By staying curi-
ous and open to new information, you can continue to refine your practices
and achieve your goals.
I’ve already used the phrase, “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” but
it is particularly relevant in the fitness industry, where quick fixes and miracle
solutions are often marketed to eager consumers. But such unrealistic prom-
ises only lead to disappointment and wasted resources.
In the world of fitness, it’s common to encounter advertisements for prod-
ucts or programs that claim to deliver rapid weight loss, muscle gain, or other
dramatic transformations with minimal effort. These claims can be enticing,
especially for those who are struggling to achieve their fitness goals. However,
the reality is that true progress is typically the result of a balanced diet, regu-
lar exercise, and a commitment to long-term lifestyle changes.
Fitness experts who “walk the walk” understand that there are no short-
cuts to achieving lasting health and fitness. They advocate for realistic goals,
evidence-based practices, and a focus on overall well-being rather than quick
fixes. By promoting a more honest and transparent approach, they help indi-
viduals set achievable expectations and build sustainable habits.

PRACTICE SELF-CARE
Ladies and gentlemen, let’s start your metabolisms! Come with me on this
12-week journey of dieting for a bodybuilding show. But first, there are
some ground rules we need to set in place.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU, NO ONE ELSE
Remember, this journey is about you—no one else. While it’s tempting
to say, “I’m doing it for my spouse,” or, “I’m doing it for my kids,” the truth
is that self-care comes first. Think of it like the safety instructions on an air-
plane: “Secure your own oxygen mask before assisting others.”
Imagine yourself as a human battery. When you’re fully charged—emo-
tionally, physically, and mentally—you can give your best to those around
you. But if you’re running on empty, you’ll be about as useful as a deflated
balloon at a birthday party. Prioritizing your own needs replenishes your
energy reserves.
Start with small goals—just like writing that first line of code as a web
developer. Over time, small steps lead to significant gains. Whether it’s self-
care, personal growth, or building an app, remember that every journey begins
with that initial spark.
So, take care of yourself. Recharge. And from there, you’ll be better
equipped to create a bright future—for both yourself and those you care about.
34 | STRONG AGAIN
START WITH SMALL GOALS
Next on our journey: avoiding burnout. When I committed to writing
these chapters, I initially expected to be exhausted from those early week-
end wake-up calls to put words on paper. Surprisingly, it’s been quite the
opposite. Last Sunday, at the ungodly hour of 3 am, I sat down to write—
and something magical happened. I hit my stride and stayed in that cre-
ative flow all day. The looming thought of, When should I start writing my
story? vanished.
We all have responsibilities—kids, partners, aging parents—but let’s focus
on ourselves first. Neglecting our own well-being risks burnout. And trust
me, burnout isn’t a badge of honor; it’s more like a sticker that says, “Hey, I
pushed myself too hard.” Prioritizing self-care is our shield against it.
Now, you might wonder, Isn’t getting up at 3 am to type on a computer a
recipe for burnout? Surprisingly, no. It energized me. Of course, this is just
Week 1; things may shift as we progress. But isn’t that the beauty of setting
goals? We’ve all tried diets or short-term challenges, but this—12 weeks—is
a marathon. And together, we’ve got this.
THE LESSONS WE TEACH
WILL ECHO THROUGH ETERNITY
My wife, Ali, and I are navigating the wild adventure of parenting—three
kids under five at the time of writing. As conscientious parents, we’ve set
boundaries for our little ones. They’ve learned that when Dad starts count-
ing to three, consequences follow. Mom, on the other hand, is still honing
her technique. Kids, well, they can be pint-sized mischief-makers at times.
And when I witness Ali wrestling with their antics, I can’t help but chuckle—
it’s like déjà vu from my own childhood with my mom.
Week 1 | 35
But here’s the thing: The lessons we impart to our kids during these for-
mative years stick with them forever. And one such lesson left an indelible
mark on me. You see, my hardworking mom was a waitress, and she kept
spare change in an old plastic butter container tucked away in her closet.
When the neighborhood boys came peddling candy for fundraisers, my lit-
tle chunky self decided to raid that container. I swiped a bunch of money to
satisfy my sweet tooth.
Fast forward to the moment my mom took that change to the bank. Her face
fell when she realized how little was there. It hit me like a ton of bricks—I’d been
a big ol’ jackass. The guilt gnawed at me, and my heart sank. Lesson learned:
Money isn’t just currency; it carries weight, memories, and responsibility.
So, as we guide our kids through life’s twists and turns, let’s hope they
remember more of the good lessons than the moments when they, too, might
act like little a-holes. After all, parenting is a wild ride, and we’re all just fig-
uring it out as we go.
YOU NEED 12 WEEKS
Setting boundaries and making this journey about you is not only accept-
able but crucial. These 12 weeks are your canvas—a chance to sculpt the best
version of yourself. Perhaps you’ve stepped on stage before, or maybe you’ve
experienced moments of leanness in your life, only to lose your way. Con-
sider this your wake-up call.
Remember, saying “no” is a superpower. When that tempting cake appears
at a party, and your friend insists, “It’s just one piece,” or, “Just try it,” chan-
nel your inner superhero and respond with a firm “NO.” Because prioritizing
yourself isn’t selfish; it’s self-care. And from that self-care, you’ll forge resil-
ience, determination, and lasting change.
So, embrace these 12 weeks. They’re not just a countdown; they’re a trans-
formational journey. And together, we’ve got this!
36 | STRONG AGAIN
FOCUS ON MEAT, VEGETABLE,
AND FRUIT PLATTERS
AT PARTIES. SKIP THE SUGAR
Alright, let’s zero in on you—the star of this show. Picture it: a vegetable
tray, a fruit platter, and a solid protein source. That’s where our focus should
be. As for the sugary BS? Let’s give it the cold shoulder.
Now, about this 12-week journey—it always kicks off with a warm-up
period in Week 1. Usually, I’m rock-solid, no cheating. But then, the week-
end swoops in. And guess what? It’s summer—the season of BBQs, ice-cream
trucks, and patio parties. Could we have picked a trickier time to diet? Prob-
ably not. But hey, when is it ever a perfect time?
TIME TO DITCH THE EXCUSES
Let’s ditch the excuses. Instead, let’s make good choices. Yesterday? Well,
it wasn’t my finest hour. Pizza, beer, and cherry crisp—yeah, I went all in.
But guess what? Day one officially starts tomorrow. And my mindset? It’s
doing a 180.
Reflecting on my recent show, one powerful takeaway stood out: I inspired
others. And you know what? It felt just as fulfilling at age 45 as it did back
when I was 25. The flood of texts I received afterward was overwhelming—
in the best way possible.
As humans, we carry an innate drive to better ourselves, to push beyond
our perceived limits. And guess what? Now is the perfect time. Prioritizing
self-care isn’t just about us; it’s a beacon for everyone around us. It’s like say-
ing, “Hey, folks, I matter, and so do you!”
So let’s lift ourselves up and encourage others along the way. Because when
we shine, we light the path for others to follow.
Week 1 | 37
WE CAN CONTROL OUR OWN SELF-CARE
Life throws curveballs and wrenches into our plans. As they say in the
movie Dodgeball, “If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.” Your
kids may be sick, or in rehab, or the black sheep; you may have elderly par-
ents with all kinds of health issues; you may have siblings dealing with addic-
tion or loss of loved ones; all of these are huge stressors in our lives. And you
may think, Not my kids, not my family, not my parents. Well, just wait! Life
happens and we can’t control it. Dealing with all these things coming into
our lives is like dodging those balls on the court and not being able to con-
trol anything. But what can we control? Looking after ourselves, which will
make us emotionally resilient. When you are emotionally resilient, you are
able to bounce back faster. You become the rubber ball, not the fragile por-
celain teacup.
START WITH A PLAN
You know that feeling when your plate is piled high—figuratively and some-
times literally? You’re juggling responsibilities, family, work, and all the little
things that make up life. And in the midst of it all, you’re the last one you
take care of. But guess what? That overflowing plate called life can lead to
more than just a few extra pounds—it can weigh down your whole existence.
Let’s dissect this:
1. The Culprit Behind Those Extra Pounds: Yep, we’ve all been there.
Stress-eating, emotional snacking, and those midnight rendezvous
with the fridge—they all add up. But it’s not just about the food;
it’s about the emotional hunger we’re trying to satisfy. When life
gets chaotic, our bodies often pay the price. So, next time you reach
for that cookie or try to finish your kids’ food at mealtimes, ask
yourself: Is it really hunger, or is it something deeper?
38 | STRONG AGAIN
2. Aging and the Great Metabolism Mystery: Our bodies are like
vintage cars—aging gracefully but with a few quirks. We tend
to move way less, hormones do their unpredictable dance, and
suddenly, we’re not burning calories like we used to. But here’s
the twist: It’s not just about the numbers on the scale. It’s about
how we move—or don’t move—through life. Our sedentary habits
sneak up on us, and suddenly, we’re wondering why our jeans feel
like they’ve shrunk. If you can name me more than two shows
besides sports that you watch, you need to move more and follow
this plan.
3. The Invisible Load: Stress—we wear it like an invisible backpack. The
bills, the deadlines, the never-ending to-do lists—they all contribute.
And guess what? Stress messes with our bodies. Cortisol levels spike,
sleep suffers, and suddenly, that salad seems less appealing than a
tub of ice cream. But here’s the truth: Prioritizing self-care isn’t
selfish; it’s survival. When your plate is overflowing, it’s time to set
some boundaries.
4. Weekend Warriors and the Art of Balance: Ah, weekends—the
double-edged sword. We either collapse into relaxation mode
(hello, Netflix and wine) or go all out (parties, gatherings, and
indulgent meals). Finding the sweet spot between self-care and
celebration is an art. Maybe it’s a morning hike followed by a
guilt-free dessert. Or perhaps it’s saying “no” to that third cocktail.
Remember, balance isn’t about perfection; it’s about intention.
This plan is to get you as “jacked” as you have ever been, then we
can switch to sensible eating using the behavior patterns learnt
through this program.
5. The Plan: Ah, yes—the elusive plan. This is about getting you to
somewhere you may have never been or reinvigorating a drive you
Week 1 | 39
may have once had. And guess what? Your current plan most likely
isn’t working. Adjust, adapt, and keep moving forward.
Let’s clear some space on that overflowing plate. Prioritize yourself. Because
when you’re nourished—mind, body, and soul—you’ll have more to give to
others. And that is the ultimate balancing act.
WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU ARE EATING
For this first week of the diet you need to take out a piece of paper and
write down what you are eating and how much water you are drinking.
Don’t use a fitness app or any of that crap. Pretend we live in the 1900s and
take out a piece of paper to write down what you consume and the time
of day. Table 1.1 has seven spaces for meals throughout the day. The goal is
to write down your daily eating habits for at least three days to get an idea
of the times you eat, and what you eat. In the next chapter we will discuss
the plan taken from what you do now and prepare for success in the com-
ing weeks. Writing all this down will poke holes in your diet regarding what
you are eating and the timing of your meals. It makes it a lot harder to eat
junk food when you must write it down. This is a surefire way to stay hon-
est with yourself.
One of the biggest impacts on my diet isn’t the food itself, but the sugar
content in those foods. I’m a huge advocate of noting the sugar content in
each of the food items you list. As you see in Table 1.1, there is a space for
calories and sugar to be listed in the last column. This is just as if not more
important than calories alone. Personally, I have the calorieking.com app on
my phone to get all the information I need on food. Use generalizations for
your foods, e.g., if you eat a McDonald’s burger and can’t find it on the app,
just put any burger on there. Don’t be picky because you will be eating clean
foods from now on. Protein bars are not all created equal, but we can dive
into those in the next few weeks. Let’s just get started with some basic info
to set up a plan we can follow.

CREATING THE MASTER PLAN
Once you find out what you are eating and are more cognizant of the caloric
breakdown, you can adjust the calories accordingly. There are seven meal
times listed in the table. You don’t need to eat seven times a day, but having
this list provides a helpful starting point for what to eat. I call this list the
“master plan.” We will deviate slightly from it here and there, and not every
day is the same to an extent, but we need to have a master plan available to
fall back on if we are to stay the course. The next table is my goal for the first
micro cycle, i.e., four weeks. See Table 1.2. The total calories for the day are
around 2,800. This is important because just small deviations will greatly
affect the total calories.
The calories per meal should be similar throughout the day, with the focus
being on protein. Dinner is the obvious one that sticks out because it has so
many calories at 869. This number is larger because I had a snack of non-fat,
Greek yogurt and a scoop of protein about an hour after dinner. I lumped
that in with my dinner mealtime because I ran out of rows on my master sheet
and some nights I want that late night snack, as long as it is healthy. While
I strive to stick to the master plan and even meals throughout the day, most
days life catches up and I miss meals or I am too full to even eat my dinner
and late snack. This plan is for a perfect eating day. When was the last time
we had one of those?
The next obvious thing is protein bars. I make sure I have a lot of these
on hand when I start my diet because if I have them readily available, I will
eat them. It’s easy to write down what’s on the nutrition label, and if you eat
similar ones all the time, they will have comparable macro nutrient content,
meaning protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Focus on the ones with at least 15
grams of protein. I prefer the One protein bar. When you can’t have glazed
maple donuts, their flavor that mimics those soft, chewy donuts really hits
the spot.

Chart 1.1 shows the macronutrient breakdown
of the meal plan. The total protein is 46% while
carbohydrates are at 21% and fat intake is at 33%.
The focus of this plan is having a higher protein
source as any one of those food items listed will
change those percentages quite a bit. This micro
cycle is a call to action to write down what you eat
and to see where you may stumble.
KEEP SUGAR LOW
Let’s talk more about the unsung villain on our list: sugar. It’s like the
sneaky gatecrasher at the party. Here’s the deal: Sugar is technically a carbo-
hydrate, so it’s lurking in the carbohydrate count and has massive effects on
inflammation and metabolic function.
Now, why the fuss about sugar? Well, let me drop some truth bombs:
Spiking your sugar levels is like inviting chaos to the party. Dropping those
extra pounds becomes a Herculean task. You can be sweating your butt off
working out and still not seeing progress. And here’s the kicker—indulging
in sugar just once a week won’t cut it. The more you give in, the more the
weight stays on. Keep an eye on the sugar count during this plan, and let’s
keep it under 50g per day.
WRITE DOWN THE TIME YOU EAT
Writing down the times is so important. The key is to eat every few hours, but
you can get lost in thinking you need to eat on the dot every three hours. No,
that is not it at all. If you know you will be too busy to eat at times, make a
plan and just double up some of those meals or skip them altogether.
Many days I will eat my yogurt and protein and then immediately have a
MACRONUTRIENTS
Chart 1.1
Week 1 | 47
protein bar. Or some days I am full so I will skip my apple and jerky before
dinner or even flip flop it with lunch.
When it comes to dinner time, I may not be in the mood for whole eggs
and beef again, so I switch it up for egg whites and a tortilla with salsa. But
here is the key: Just switching whole eggs to egg whites and taking out the
hamburger reduced my daily calories by 800. I went from 2,800 to 2,000
just for that day. Those small choices add up.
HAVE A PLAN TO FALL BACK ON
The main takeaway is you need a master plan to fall back on. And if this
is your first time wanting to do a show, or get to your goal weight, don’t devi-
ate from it. At all! My very first show I had four plastic containers with times
written on them in permanent marker for when I was supposed to eat. I was
hyper-focused on sticking to it, and I have learned so much from it.
You may be asking, where are your vegetables? Vegetables are not listed
on the food plan and we will get to those later, but for right now we need
to focus on just writing down your main calorie intakes from proteins, fats,
and carbohydrates along with those villainous sugars. The food list has the
macronutrients laid out for you for each food item. Write those on your plan
and calculate it once, then you will have that for four weeks without ever
counting a calorie again. You should just know it. Let’s take this one step at
a time and focus on writing down the foods you will consume for the next
four weeks. You must do what you have never done to get what you have
never gotten.
We all fall short of being the best we can be at times. Having this plan
means you have one less thing to think about, and you can focus on other
people because you are already hitting one of your goals each day. When real
life hits and you aren’t focused on a nutrition plan, you will spend your time
sitting around thinking, What should I eat, or, Meh, I don’t feel like chicken
48 | STRONG AGAIN
tonight, maybe I’ll just pick something up. I fall short in my meal prep outside
of a show when I don’t have a plan dialed in. And when I say fall, I mean
right off a cliff. But some of you reading this may think, Shit, these are my
everyday meals.
I tend to try and start breakfast with something healthy, like a workout and
a coffee. Jeez, I am lazy. Post morning workout I eat a protein bar or have a
protein drink. Then a couple hours later driving to clients houses I grab some
beef jerky or beef sticks to fill me up. Hours later I am pretty famished so I
decide to run to a local fast-food place and get a double bacon burger with
a large milkshake. I did a nosedive—straight into the abyss of poor choices:
87 grams of sugar for the day, 86 of which was from my shake after dinner!
How many of you do this?
Here is the summary of my decision-making process from Microsoft copi-
lot (Microsoft, 2025):
Picture this: I kick off the day with a protein drink—my morning salute
to gains. But then life happens. The gas station beckons, and I grab those beef
sticks—because, hey, protein, right? Fast-forward to evening chaos: kids still
bouncing off walls, wife at her wit’s end. Dinner? Ha! It’s a distant dream. So,
hello, fast-food joint—I’ll take a side of regret with that burger.
Now, let’s dissect this crash landing:
1. The Familiar Rut: This scenario? It’s my life’s greatest hits—unless
I’m laser-focused on weight loss or channeling my inner health guru
(or prepping for a show). It’s the rhythm of existence: busy, chaotic,
and nutritionally questionable.
2. Beef Stick Chronicles: Ah, those beef sticks—the silent cholesterol
culprits. In my 40s, I had an epiphany: These savory snacks were
stacking up against my ticker. So, I decided to break up with them.
And guess what? My cholesterol numbers did a happy dance.
3. The Fork in the Road: Here’s the raw truth: It’s decision time. Either
Week 1 | 49
I embrace health and confidence-building—or I keep riding the
fast-food express. No more fence-sitting; it’s time to choose: Shit
or get off the pot (pardon my French).
IF YOU LOSE FOCUS,
TIME TO REFOCUS … NOW!
Wow, I just had a wake-up call. I wrote out what I ate yesterday during a
weekend getaway up north. I stated earlier that I had pizza and cherry crisp,
but doing the calculations floored me. More than 5,000 calories for the day!
Must be bulk season, LOL. I will start focusing today. How many times have
we said this on the weekends at a getaway: I am going to eat really well! As
will most people at weekend parties, things may get out of hand, especially
if you are trying to eat healthy but the taste of that sweet and savory food on
your lips is too inviting. Yes, you may not have five or six slices of pizza, or
you may have vodka instead of beer, but in reality, losing focus on your diet
is not good for what you want to accomplish.
TIME TO COMMIT
We are committing to 12 weeks, during which time we’re not just sculpt-
ing bodies; we’re forging character. We’re not just counting calories; we’re
counting victories—over that little voice that says, Hit the drive-thru, buddy,
or, It is just a little piece. Hell no! We’re not here for shortcuts; we’re here for
transformation.
The 12 weeks of this program is called a macro cycle. We are focusing on
Week 1, taking one step at a time. We break down our master plan into four-
week micro cycles, with each having a slightly different focus. Try to stick to
the master plan as best as you can. And since it is football season at time of
writing, here are some words from Microsoft Copilot AI coach, and honestly,
I can’t say it much better than this (Microsoft, 2025):

The Diet Commitment
1. Breakfast Blitz: Rise and shine, warriors! Breakfast isn’t just a meal;
it’s our battle cry. You know what’s tougher than a linebacker? A
bowl of oatmeal with a side of egg whites. Fuel up, because today,
we conquer.
2. Protein Power: Chicken, fish, tofu—whatever floats your protein
boat. It’s not just about gains; it’s about resilience. Every gram of
protein is a brick in our fortress of determination.
3. Veggies, Not Sissies: Broccoli, spinach, kale—they’re not just greens;
they’re Hulk fuel. They’ll make you stronger, faster, and more agile.
Eat ’em like you’re devouring opponents on the field.
4. Hydration Nation: Water isn’t just for thirst; it’s for victory. Guzzle it
down like a touchdown celebration. Your body is a high-performance
machine; don’t you dare run it on low-grade fuel.
5. Snack Defense: When the vending machine winks at you, flip it
the bird. Our snacks are almonds, Greek yogurt, and protein bars.
They’re our secret weapons against fourth-quarter fatigue.

HEARTY, HEALTHY FOODS
You will always hear that protein is king. But why is that? I have always
known you need to consume a lot of protein for muscle growth and
repair, but is too much bad for your kidneys? Even while talking about
diets to our friends, I question whether I should have as much as I do. And
how much protein is too much? Well, these are all good questions we need
to dive into.
My food list always contains a lot of protein shakes, meal replacements,
and on-the-go type foods like beef jerky and protein bars. Life gets busy, and
most of the time we forego eating to take care of work or other people. It’s
easy for skipping meals to become a habit when you are busy taking care of
something or someone else.
I grew up on a dairy farm during my teenage years, working with my uncle
from 4 am until 6 pm. As I’ve mentioned before, we always said working
for eight hours a day was like having a day off. And we were weren’t sitting
around the kitchen table or at a restaurant thinking about food. We would
wake up at 4 am, put on our barn clothes, and head to the farm. After fin-
ishing chores around 7 am, we would come back home to a warm, cooked
meal from grandma and catch a power nap for 15 minutes.
BREAKFAST IS STILL THE MOST
IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY
56 | STRONG AGAIN
Breakfast always had a protein source like eggs, a side of some type of meat
like ham or bacon, and two pieces of toast. And since grandma baked all the
time, we usually had cake or cookies. Everything was fresh from the farm.
With the wisdom of hindsight, I now recognize the importance of a warm,
cooked meal. It’s not just about fueling your system with healthy calories and
fats—it’s also about the cherished moments spent in the kitchen with family.
Those mornings, stirring pots and savoring the aroma of breakfast, are
etched in my memory. Sometimes, even when my uncle or I arrived a tad
late—8 am instead of the usual 7 am—there would be a pot cover over the
eggs, keeping them warm. It’s these small gestures—the love and care woven
into every meal—that matter most.
And when my wife and I became parents, I knew I wanted our kids to
experience the same warmth. My schedule often finds me up before the sun,
ensuring that breakfast is ready. Grandma’s legacy lives on, and I’m grateful
to pass that same love to my own children.
My uncle was 50/50 on whether he was coming home or not for break-
fast. There was always machinery or something that needed to be worked
on. After I caught a few winks, it was time to head back to the farm to put a
full day’s work in. When I was able to drive and more involved with sports, I
would do chores in the morning, come home to eat, shower, and then drive
to my hometown of Mauston to work out at the high school gym for an hour,
then head back home to get in the fields.
Ah, the mysterious teenage years—when you could devour an entire pizza
and still emerge unscathed. But is it really because of growth spurts and calo-
rie-burning magic? Why is obesity and type 2 diabetes on such a rise among
young people these days? Let’s dive into this.
Observing my uncle’s farm life over the past three decades and listening
to other parents, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not merely about eat-
ing with reckless abandon. Instead, there’s been a seismic shift in our nutri-
tional landscape and the sedentary nature of our lifestyles.
Consider this: Many kids today miss out on warm, home-cooked meals.
Week 2 | 57
Instead, they’re handed highly-processed grains and sugar for breakfast, fol-
lowed by a repeat performance at lunch. And dinner? Well, sometimes it’s a
drive-thru dash—because their schedules rival those of Fortune 500 CEOs.
So, while the teenage metabolism might be a superhero, our food choices
play the villain. Maybe it’s time we swapped the fast-food cape for a chef ’s
apron and rediscovered the magic of wholesome meals. After all, nourishing
our bodies isn’t just about calories; it’s about savoring moments and build-
ing a healthier future.
LIFE HAPPENS, AND FAST
In my teenage years, I’d hit the gym for school sports, but on off days, I’d run
a few miles along quiet country roads. My uncle, only 11 years older than me,
joined in—he was still playing basketball in an “old man’s league.” Now, at
45, I’ve realized I’m two decades older than he was during those games. Yet,
we both got in great shape: I improved my lung capacity, and he leaned out,
prioritizing breakfast before tackling the day.
RECOGNIZE EXCUSES
Fast forward 25 years, and kids happened, life happened, and schedules
fill up mighty fast. You will not convince me that you are so busy you can’t
work out or eat healthily, but I will give you my two cents on why you are
full of shit and have nothing but excuses. And it’s okay, everyone has them,
but we need to start recognizing them.
PRIORITIZING EVERYONE ELSE EXCEPT YOU
When I finished college and graduate school, I would rarely come back
home just because my life was getting started in the “real world.” Each time
58 | STRONG AGAIN
I came home I would see a shift in my uncle’s lifestyle. Now, we loved our
pizza and would occasionally treat ourselves in those memorable teenage
years, but it was still mainly hearty foods like steak, potatoes, and vegetables.
In my late 20s, when my uncle started having kids, it was more about
quick and easy foods like highly-processed chips and sugary kids’ yogurts.
They also had to make time to take their kids to play sports, meaning they
had to start work on the farm earlier or finish later. If you know any small
dairy farmers, ask them how many vacations they go on or how much time
they can spend away from the farm. It is not much at all. But as parents we
will sacrifice a lot to give our children the opportunities we never had. This
ties back into self-care from Week 1, and we usually abandon taking care of
ourselves in favor of looking after our children.
My uncle, despite neglecting his own well-being, remains a devoted dad.
But at what cost? How many obese 70-year-olds do you see? His kids—tow-
ering farm boys—are massive, all 6’4” to 6’8”. The youngest, a 15-year-old,
wears size 15 shoes but is severely overweight. And those Danimals yogurts?
Sugar-laden nonsense marketed with colorful animals. Seeing those still trig-
gers me to this day and reminds me of fat, lazy kids. Our society—overweight
and undisciplined—needs a reality check. We’ve got work to do.
I CAN EAT WHATEVER I WANT
For 17 years, running my own gym, I’ve seen countless kids who claim they
can’t gain weight despite eating freely. But here’s the truth: Their “whatever-I-
want” often translates to fast-food junk—nutritionally empty so overeating is
easy, and that’s an understatement. You fill up on these empty calories from
fast food and have zero nutrient dense foods to make you satiated.
Now, I won’t bash fast-food joints—I loved them once I could drive.
Back in the day, it was “Monster Burgers” and “Super-Size Me.” My buddy
Matt and I, after hardcore workouts, indulged in two monster burgers and
Week 2 | 59
fries each week. We both grew up wearing husky jeans and always felt a little
“fluffy,” but lifting weights transformed us. Suddenly, we ate with purpose—
for muscle gain, strength, and, well, chicks. Weekends? Pizza and Arnie mov-
ies—without chicks, unfortunately!
Eating fast food occasionally for a treat is not a big deal, but it’s bad news
if it’s regularly making up your meals. Matt and I grew up on home cooked,
hearty food. Adding in fast food assisted in our goals to put on weight along
with nutritious meals from home, not just the fast food by itself. But adding
in the weight training was the key. Muscle is your metabolism.
Protein repairs and builds your muscle, hence increasing your metabo-
lism. When you constantly eat fast food, you are not building lean tissue and
you are increasing your chance of heart disease. Studies show that it starts at
a young age. We would eat fast food for extra calories to build as much mus-
cle as we could. At 16 years old, we didn’t know better.
DO YOUR RESEARCH
Let’s address the elephant in the room—no, not an overweight sibling.
Is too much protein harmful? You need to educate yourself. Skip the advice
from friends and consult a doctor who understands fitness. Or delve into
books on insulin levels and metabolic syndrome.
Recently, I read a mind-blowing book called The Lies I Taught in Medical
School (Lufkin, 2024). It boldly claims that carbohydrates are non-essential
nutrients. Our bodies can create glucose from fats and proteins. Remember
“Syndrome X”? It emerged in the ’90s as is now known as metabolic syndrome.
Dive deeper—it’s eye-opening. As I explore more books on this topic, our
national health issues become clearer.
Not all doctors are created equal, so get two or three opinions. And do
your blood work! Your general practitioner will run a basic test on you for
cholesterol, but get the extra work done for your kidney and liver health as
60 | STRONG AGAIN
well as insulin resistance. I have been getting my blood work done every six
months just to see what my kidneys, liver, and cholesterol are doing.
When my firefighter friend warned me that too much protein isn’t good
for your kidneys, I briefly questioned myself. I realized that, from their point
of view, too much protein is bad. Look at the people they help: They are usu-
ally drugged-out young to middle-aged people, or old people on so many
prescription medications they have fallen and can’t get up. For them, protein
is bad for the kidneys because it will exacerbate problems. Firefighters rarely
fight fire, it seems. They push more Narcan than water. You need to be dil-
igent and find out for yourself how much protein is too much by how you
feel or get your blood work done.
1 GRAM PER POUND OF BODYWEIGHT
K.I.S.S. (KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID)
The general rule of thumb has always been 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein
per kilogram of bodyweight. Basically, you need a gram per pound of body-
weight. At my last blood test, my liver enzymes were high. My doc asked if I
was eating too much protein. I told him, “Yes, I have about 200-240 grams
per day.” He said, “Okay, that’s not it then because I have guys eating 400
grams per day.”
We discovered my liver enzymes are most likely high because I had been
doing a ton of high-intensity cardio. I was trying to see what my body could
handle before it broke down. One of my workouts, to put it in perspective,
was heavy lifting in the morning, a two-mile run for time in the afternoon,
followed immediately by burning 50 calories on the assault bike for time,
followed immediately by a 1,000m row in under three minutes. The very
next day I ran the farthest I have ever run in my life, which was a half mara-
thon. The following day I did my blood test after working out in the morn-
ing once again.
Week 2 | 61
THE POWER OF PROTEIN
Why is protein so important? Yes, protein builds muscle. But it isn’t just about
size; it’s about strength, resilience, and repair. Protein is like a construction
crew repairing potholes on your personal highway. It is the foundation of
your metabolism. As we age, everyone wants to find excuses for their weight
gain. Well, people need to quit lying to themselves. The truth is, we need
more protein, and our nutrition should focus on that.
Protein is the furnace for burning calories off your body, but did you know
that you also burn energy just by consuming it? Your body, in retrospect, has
a love/hate relationship with protein. The body loves it for repair and build-
ing muscle but hates having to use it as an energy source. It takes your body
more energy to strip that nitrogen molecule off that amino acid to use it for
energy. If you consume carbohydrates and fat in your meals, those are easily
stored and used as energy.
PROTEIN, CARBS, AND FATS. OH MY …
Protein’s job is to get into your body and repair and build. But when you
are watching your caloric intake and eating clean, i.e., moderate carbs and
healthy fats, your protein must not only build and repair, but it also must be
used as an energy source. This is where the fat burning really takes off. It is
called the thermogenic effect of food. Thermo means heat. Heat is an expen-
diture of energy. Calories are energy. So, by consuming protein, you burn
more calories.
I am usually pretty good at eating protein. But off the diet, I like to indulge
in Sunday morning pancakes with the kids. And it is like eating at a Chi-
nese buffet: You leave stuffed to the gills, but two hours later you are hun-
gry as hell again.
Protein keeps hunger at bay. Relying solely on carbs leaves you craving
more within hours. And those church donuts? Tempting, but beware. I’ve
62 | STRONG AGAIN
learned the hard way: Sunday treats won’t spare your six-pack. When diet-
ing, skip the “have your cake and eat it” mindset.
CURB YOUR APPETITE, FUEL YOUR BODY
Protein will help curb your appetite. But I have learned that you need to
eat enough when on a higher protein diet. For me, 400 calories per meal is
the key because I will feel it in my blood sugar levels. When you get a little
woozy or shaky and have that “flushed” feeling, it is your blood sugar drop-
ping like a rock. Usually, that only happens when you first get back into work-
ing out and is easily remedied by having another protein shake and waiting
10 minutes.
I recognize low blood sugar when I train kids who are new to working
out. They become ghostly white and usually throw up because they didn’t eat
beforehand. Usually, the biggest mistake they make is chugging lots of water
without electrolytes in it, thinking that will help. It doesn’t.
You need to figure out what works for you: eating before, during, or after
the gym. Then do that.
IMMUNE HEALTH
Since the pandemic, I’ve noticed that those who are heavier and more
inflamed tend to struggle more with COVID-19. Others might experience
milder symptoms like headaches or congestion.
Protein helps build your immune system. And having a protein-focused
diet will keep inflammation down so your body’s natural systems can oper-
ate on full power. Fueling your body with protein will help fight disease and
burn fat with ease instead of trying to make itself healthy by eliminating
inflammation all the time.
Week 2 | 63
Having rolled up your sleeves and gotten after this diet, you need to focus
on eating healthy foods. But timing is also important to keep that metabolic
furnace roaring throughout the day. That is why protein shakes are super easy;
you can mix them anywhere or use the pre-mixed ones. You need to find ways
to fill those gaps throughout the day.
WHAT IS THE COST FOR YOUR HEALTH?
Another thought just popped into my head. You will always hear the
excuse, “It costs so much to eat healthy.” Well, guess what? It is because you
are actually eating more frequently than just one or two meals a day and
not skipping meals or just grabbing occasional snacks. *Poof,* I just had an
epiphany. Financially, it balances out to eat healthy. You save by cutting out
spending on junk foods and alcohol, but you invest in nutritious foods that
you’ll consume more frequently.
Following this diet will get you the results you want. But it’s also possible
to get what you need very cheaply. When I was in college, I could always go
back to peanut butter and wonder bread if I needed to save a buck. After all,
I had to make sure I had money for all that beer I was drinking!
I have three kids and they love eating hamburgers, eggs, vegetables, turkey,
chicken, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, pretzels, and hummus … all of which
will be on your food list. My go-to for “cheap eating” is Greek yogurt mixed
with protein powder. A 32oz container of Greek yogurt costing under $5 can
last for three meals over two days with a $1.50 scoop of protein mixed in each
time. That’s roughly $3.16 per meal. Add a meal replacement shake for under $4
twice a day mixed with another protein scoop and there you have it … college
food costs but you will be super jacked and not putting on the Freshman 15!
CONSISTENCY IS KEY
64 | STRONG AGAIN
Eating protein throughout the day will keep your calories burning. But
you need to keep it simple. I have a refrigerator at the gym where I keep my
Greek yogurts and other food. But I also learned to drink my protein shakes
with tap water at room temperature. Pro tip: Never leave your shaker bottle
closed in the car during the summer. It will smell like complete ass the next
time you open it. You have been warned.
The key is to use the master plan as your template. Not every day is the
same at work and home, I know. But try to stick to your plan as best you
can and say no to other foods or distractions. Plan or make healthy choices
when you are in those situations.
Keeping your foods simple will give you more time. You will have more
nutrient-dense foods and not get decision fatigue by staring at a menu think-
ing, What should I eat? You already know what you should eat, and now you
need to break it down. Take out the list of foods you ate last week. You should
have written out at least three days’ worth. Now you know your habits in
terms of what you are eating and when, you can replace those foods with
healthier options to get jacked.
FINDING YOUR GROOVE
The first step was to write down what you ate and when. Evenly spacing out
the times you eat will dictate what you will be eating and when. Now, if you
work from home, you can have whole foods like rice, beef, and vegetables all
day, which is ideal. But we tend to gravitate towards quicker and easier foods.
The master plan will help divide the day so you can make quick choices that
are better for you and faster to prepare.
I have a lot of quick protein drinks and bars in my master plan, and that
is by design. I am always on my feet working with people, and grabbing a
bar is way easier than heating up rice and chicken in the microwave. On the
weekends, I focus on more eggs, beef, and chicken. That is why it is impor-
tant to write down what you eat and when over the weekends, because it can
be drastically different to the working week.
Week 2 | 65
Weekends are a time to relax and go out and have a few drinks with friends
or family. But for this diet you need to be more specific with your plan for
the day. If you go to the movies, get a diet soda or water and plain popcorn
without butter. If you are heading to a party at a bar or restaurant, have pro-
tein drinks or eat before you go. Trust me on this one because I have done
it numerous times.
I am an “all or nothing” person, and if I taste something that I shouldn’t
have at a party, it is game over for me. As hard as I try to stay on a strict diet
like this, I have sometimes failed, and you could see the results on stage at
certain shows. One M&M led to a family-sized pack four weeks from the
show, and I could still see the results of that slip up on stage.
My general rule of thumb for the first four weeks of my diet is 40% pro-
tein, 40% carbohydrate, and 20% fat for the foods I’m eating. I calculate the
calories using calorieking.com. Interestingly, when you start picking foods
from your new shopping list and putting them into different combinations
for meals, the ratio is always close to that 40-40-20. That is the power of
whole foods and not just highly-processed foods.
The next step is to create meals from your food list. Focus on whole foods
and spacing out your calories. Your weekend schedule may be different than
your weekly routine, but try and stick to a similar eating plan and use any extra
time during the weekend to plan out your next week’s schedule and to meal prep.
This weekend I went slightly off the master plan but stayed within my
macronutrient parameters. The protein was close to the goal of a 40-40-20
ratio for macronutrients. The timing of the food and the calorie intake was
also pretty even, which allows for even blood sugar throughout the day.
I took my kids to the local splash pad and there was a baseball game being
played at the park. Free chicken sandwiches and $1 hot dogs. That was amaz-
ing! Now, I don’t have peanuts on the list; I include olive oil instead for com-
parable macronutrients. The same goes with the hot dog I ate at the game;
I put a beef stick in its place on the list. Having a master plan is a guide to
success, not a prison from which there’s no escape.

Action Steps
• Develop your master plan from the food list and try to get a 40-40-
20 ratio
• How much do you weigh? Add a zero to that for how many calo-
ries you should eat each day and space out your meals
• Your favorite food not on the list? By all means try and squeeze it in,
but if your butt doesn’t fit in your jeans, it shouldn’t be on the list

THE FOOD LIST
Today, we’re bombarded by ads and marketing, telling us what to eat
and wear. Companies spend billions annually to hook us, the little fish
swimming around cluelessly. Every dollar we spend sends a few cents
their way. When everyone buys the marketed item, those cents add up to
massive profits. These profits grow even more if the company manufactures
overseas in countries with cheaper labor. It’s all a game of “follow the money.”
Day to day, you’ll see people staring at the vitamin aisle or wandering the
grocery store, unsure of what to buy. It’s time-consuming and frustrating.
That’s why having a food list is crucial—one filled with whole foods packed
with essential nutrients to fuel your day and melt fat. If you look at this list
and think, I don’t see pesto sauce or linguini noodles, that’s intentional. This is
a food list for getting jacked. Nothing against pesto or linguini, but if you’re
eating that stuff, you’re probably struggling to look like a GQ cover model
and barely pulling off National Enquirer.
SIMPLIFY MEAL PLANNING
Having a food list is important because it simplifies meal planning and
grocery shopping. You can quickly identify what you need and easily ignore
the bombardment of marketing. My wife does grocery pick up and usually
is pretty frugal. I prefer to shop in the store, and if I have all three kids, then
so be it. I pull two carts, one with two kids in and the other with one. We
70 | STRONG AGAIN
have fun, play games, and I love it when I’m called “super dad.” I call it the
“trains for gains” as we pick up eggs, Greek yogurt, meats, veggies, hummus,
jerky, and, of course, our protein powders and bars if we need it that week.
I am still like a big kid, so we always swing by the toy aisles to see the latest
Star Wars merchandise; oh yeah, and toys for my kids too. We are literally in
and out of the grocery store in 15-20 mins max.
Having a food list and sticking to it helps maintain consistency in your
diet. It will make tracking your nutritional intake easier and ensure you are
meeting your goals. Yes, I understand people love to cook and bake, but for
this diet we need 12 weeks of results, not 20 years of trying but failing. It is
time to keep it simple. This often means whole, unprocessed foods, which
are nutrient dense to ensure you are getting the essential vitamins and min-
erals without the added sugars.
Lastly, a simple food list streamlines your choices. Having that limited
selection of food reduces the number of decisions you need to make daily.
Life gets busy; the last thing you want to do is skip meals all the time or find
yourself famished by the end of the day and then overeat whatever you can
cook up in 10 minutes, which is usually a pizza or chicken tenders. Mini-
mizing your choices will help you avoid unhealthy foods and stay focused
on your dietary goals. Staying on your goals, especially when the weekends
come, is key to leaning out.
STICK TO THE PLAN THIS WEEKEND
I told my client today, who mentioned he gained eight pounds this sum-
mer, “Dang, lots of beer, hey?” He admitted it was due to using a cart more
instead of walking when playing golf, drinking beer afterward, and having a
busy summer. When I suggested his teenagers might be influencing his diet,
he said, “No, it’s all me.” I thought, “Holy crap, someone actually fesses up
and takes ownership.” It’s rare, but great, that he held himself accountable.
Week 3 | 71
I advised him to stick to healthy eating for the next week, emphasizing
that weekends are the hardest. If he can maintain good habits during the
week and carry them into the weekend, he’ll effectively string together two
weeks of healthy eating. Most people falter on weekends, but staying con-
sistent through Friday night and planning ahead can make all the difference.
Once he makes it through the weekend, another workweek will be simple,
adding up to 12 days of healthy eating. The key is to stick to the plan, espe-
cially on weekends.
THE MASTER PLAN
Incorporating a simple food list into your master plan and following it is key
to your success every single day. If you can eat simply, and pretty much the
same thing every day, you will lose weight. You can take it up a notch and
even compete in a local show. It only takes 12 weeks. I have been 265 pounds
and 283 pounds in my career as a personal trainer. Both weight gains were
for powerlifting, which for me was a horrible diet. The funny thing is that
it was similar to most people’s “normal” diet, except I pretty much doubled
the portions for the calorie intake. I would always opt for the triple burger at
fast food places and try to eat as many pizzas as I could before bed. I was up
to regularly eating two regular crust 12” pizzas for dinner. My heart thanked
me after losing all the weight. I had to switch gears to lose weight because I
injured my shoulder and didn’t feel like powerlifting any more. It is a grind
and, like most sports, it is about who is willing to suffer the pain the longest
and at what cost. I did my 12-week diet and got back down to 220 pounds
to start martial arts again. In the words of Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon,
“I’m getting too old for this shit.” I’ll never stop training for goals, but once
in a while you need to take a different approach.
BREAK YOUR NUTRITION DOWN INTO BLOCKS
72 | STRONG AGAIN
I break down the master plan into three micro cycles. Micro cycle one cov-
ers the first four weeks of eating. This phase cuts out junk food and focuses
on what we should eat to reach our goals. The initial four weeks of any new
nutrition plan can be exciting—you’ll likely see immediate weight loss from
cutting carbs. However, after shedding the initial five to 10 pounds of water
weight, the scale may not budge for the rest of this phase. You might even
gain a little weight as you start eating more nutrient-dense foods.
Why so much drop in weight the first week of most diets? You may have
heard the term “water weight” before. Most diets start with cutting out carbo-
hydrates. For each gram of carbohydrate ingested, four grams of water must tag
along to be absorbed with it. This is what causes inflammation with those late-
night binges and a carb-rich diet. That finger tightness you feel in the morn-
ing after eating heavy meals the night before or partying and overconsuming
food and alcohol … yeah, that is inflammation from all the carbohydrates.
I finished a show June 1, 2024. I motivated a lot of people that motivated
me to write this book. I started the diet at 223lbs. This is typically a nor-
mal “walk around” weight for me, just managing what I eat. This past year
my goal was to not eat sugar in the form of cakes, cookies, and candy, so I
at least started with a decent physique right away. But whether at 223lbs or
283lbs, all the rules still applied with following a master plan for 12 weeks.
The first week I got down to 218lbs and stayed there until about Week 7,
when I dropped to 213lbs. I was pretty happy even though weight loss isn’t
the goal. But the next Monday I weighed back in around 219lbs. WTF? Did
I get fat? No, it is all water balance. My body was still obviously full from
having a heavy carb load day on Thursdays.
So, the first week you diet you will only lose water weight. Great job, but
stick with it. This is where the hard part begins. Around 90% of you will
quit after one week because next weekend is a bachelor/bachelorette party,
wedding, birthday, reunion … There is never a good time to diet, but there
is always a good time to make better choices.
Back to my bodybuilding diet: I weighed in at 197lbs for the show. I
Week 3 | 73
looked more like a triathlete than a bodybuilder, but I was happy with my
physique after 12 years off the stage and at 45 years old. I dehydrated on Fri-
day and most of Saturday before the show. After the show, I had a big steak
dinner with sweet potato fries and about six glasses of water. I woke up Sun-
day morning feeling like my skin was about to rip in half. It was so tight,
and my muscles were full. With about eight shows under my belt, I need
to try eating out the night before the next show to get that feel. I’ve always
been afraid of carb spillover, where cells burst with inflammation, making
you look watery and flat. But the morning after the show, I was still jacked
and weighed 215lbs. Holy crap! But beware, if you do that for two or three
days, and it’s no longer a diet, you’ll get softer and flabbier. It’s all practice
for that day or two leading up to a show, but I may have found the key for
my next show.
This illustrated how carbohydrates and water affect weight. I gained 17
pounds in a day from water and carbs. My body fat stayed the same, but my
muscles were much fuller. My flab was not there either before or after. The
initial weight loss is carb control, and if you are a numbers person that is awe-
some, because you will see the scale go down fast the first week or two. But
consistency is going to keep the body fat burning.
As a coach, I like to teach the same concepts in different ways because
everyone learns differently. Your body stores carbohydrates in your muscle
as glycogen for energy use. Too much carbohydrate and it will store it is as
fat. Think of your muscle as the difference between a dry sponge and a wet
sponge. Both look similar but do not weigh the same. The dry sponge rep-
resents muscles low on carbs, making them lighter but similar in appearance
to muscles with better carb balance. The wet sponge represents muscles full
of carbs, making them heavier and denser. It is crucial to have that balance
of carbs because you don’t want too many to be fat, and you don’t want too
little to not be able to have great muscle tone.
Why not just aim for a lighter scale weight with fewer carbs like the dry
sponge? The problem is you break down too much muscle tissue—muscle is
74 | STRONG AGAIN
your metabolism. Ever hear of a super-jacked bodybuilder who was anorexic?
Exactly, it’s impossible. On any diet, you’ll lose some muscle, but you need to
get lean to stay lean. Without a master plan, you’re just running on a ham-
ster wheel. Stick to the plan for balanced, sustainable results.
PLAN, PLAN, PLAN
The key question is how many carbs are too many? That is why we need
the master plan. Stick to the 40-40-20 ratio and you will be fine. Reach your
calorie goal for your basal metabolic rate (BMR) for the day and you will see
the fat fall off by Week 7 and Week 8.
HOW MANY CARBS ARE TOO MANY?
BASAL METABOLIC RATE
Sitting on your butt right now, reading this and just breathing, you are burning
calories. If you are eating that may be a moot point! But either way, just by living
you use energy. This is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR. Your BMR is
how many calories your body needs to have the energy for all the basic functions
of day-to-day living. If you are sitting on the john right now reading, yes, you
are burning calories. The easiest way to figure out your BMR is to just add a zero
to your weight. You weigh 235lbs, your BMR is roughly 2,350 calories per day.
Using Microsoft Copilot, you can easily find out the formula for BMR
(Microsoft, 2025).
HARRIS-BENEDICT EQUATION
For Men:
BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 × weight in kg) + (5.003 × height
in cm) − (6.755 × age in years)
Week 3 | 75
For Women:
BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 × weight in kg) + (1.85 × height
in cm) − (4.676 × age in years)
MIFFLIN-ST JEOR EQUATION
For Men:
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) −
(5 × age in years) + 5
For Women:
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) −
(5 × age in years) – 161
I used to put the numbers in an Excel program to figure out my exact
BMR, but now I can just ask AI with the prompt of my age, height, and
weight. Here are the results:
Age: 45 years Height: 6’1” (185 cm) Weight: 220lbs (99.79 kg)
Using the Harris-Benedict Equation for men:
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height
in cm) − (5.677 × age in years)
BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 99.79) + (4.799 × 185) −
(5.677 × 45)
BMR = 88.362 + 1,335.868 + 887.315 − 255.465
BMR = 2,056 calories/day
So, my BMR is approximately 2,056 calories per day. This is the number
of calories my body needs at rest to maintain basic bodily functions.
76 | STRONG AGAIN
Understanding BMR and knowing how many calories your body is burn-
ing is crucial for losing weight and being healthy. Why? Going too low may
add stress to your organs. Earlier, I pointed out that being in a calorie defi-
cit while doing a show and super-intense cardio will elevate my white blood
cell count and liver enzymes. Going this low is a recipe for sickness because
it will lower my immune system. Having too many calories will cause the
body to store them in your thighs or abdomen, and you will have the shape
of an apple or a pear.
Once you know your BMR, it will be your guide to reach those calories
every day by eating what you have on your list. Do not stray from those calo-
ries, because those are the optimal to function every day. Feeling tired? Prob-
ably too few calories. Sleeping like crap? Most likely due to too many carbs
throughout the day, so increase your protein and fats. You should always be
around that mark for trying to get as lean as you can. Especially during these
first four weeks.
I have always planned out my first four weeks with a strict diet, but with
more fat and carbs involved. This is just to take pleasure in eating some bread
here and there without going bonkers. The biggest takeaway is to stay away
from sugar. Sugar is the death of diets. Recently, my wife and I have been
helping a friend of ours with dieting. She was a stick-thin high schooler but
is now in her mid to late 20s and wants to lose 50lbs. Her thinking is that
having those one or two cheat days each week still falls within a healthy eat-
ing plan. You may have heard of the 80-20 rule. The rule states that 80% of
your meals should be clean and healthy and 20% can be a little looser. Well,
following that rule is not working for her.
You need to stick with strict first, get to the goal, then allow wiggle room
to truly understand what the 80-20 rule is about. Because I guarantee you that
her 80% isn’t what is on the food list and she is getting duped by marketing.
Sticking with a calorie goal around your BMR allows the wiggle room.
If I come home late but I am still hungry, I will sit down and have grapes,
pretzels, and hummus or even make myself some more eggs. They are all
Week 3 | 77
still healthy food items on the list, and with low sugar. The main reason I
am coming home still hungry is because I didn’t eat enough throughout
the day. And that is most likely your problem too. You need to eat enough
throughout the day to not have that famished feeling at night. I have a bad
habit of getting beef sticks on my way home after work because I know I
will be starving by the time I get there. But if I plan my day accordingly,
this rarely happens. Beef sticks are delicious and there is nothing wrong
with them as a grab-and-go snack. But seeing those cholesterol numbers I
had last year makes me think twice before getting some. There are healthier
beef sticks that I need to explore, with less sugar and better ingredients—
just beef, basically.
METABOLIC RATE DECREASES WITH MUSCLE LOSS
Your age, gender, and body composition affect your BMR. It will decrease
with age, because you lose muscle mass. Let me repeat that again for everyone
who uses age as an excuse: Your metabolism slows with muscle loss. When I
hear people say, “Wait until you get to my age,” or something similar, I want
to scream. I had a client this past winter look at my picture of past shows in
the gym and say, “You are going to look like that again? Ha, good luck.” That
is all I needed to solidify my goal. Yes, it was 12 years ago for that past show.
But now, at 45, I look the exact same on stage as I did back then.
You can look at that in two ways: One, I look the exact same as I did back
then and haven’t improved; or two, I look damn good for 45. In bodybuild-
ing, we always want to be bigger and better than the day before or pictures
before, so looking the same is kind of a letdown. For me, I want to look good
naked and have a lot of fun training to achieve that look. So yes, according
to the world of bodybuilding, I didn’t eat enough chicken and rice to gain
the muscle size and weight. However, I did prove that you can do this at any
age, and I had a blast getting back on stage.
78 | STRONG AGAIN
DON’T GET FOOLED BY YOUR TECHNOLOGY
I remember the days of the popular fitness apps called Livestrong and MyFit-
nessPal. Every day, friends and clients would ask themselves, “How many
calories did I burn, how long was my workout, what can I eat today?” They
would literally be glued to those things. Maybe they are still popular, but
I’ve never used them because it was a pain to log everything. I like easy! After
doing a show and writing my own master plan back in 2004 with a pencil
and paper, I stuck with that and only that. Why would I need to keep fill-
ing in my food every day?
I have come across people who need to eat something different every night
for dinner or need to eat something “fresh” from the local markets. Most
people who think like that have a problem losing weight in the first place.
I mean, you can only cook a chicken so many ways, but dang, you need to
get creative with your spices. And guess what, this is for 12 weeks. If you can
stick with your plan for one week, hammer through a weekend for another
busy week, you will start shedding the pounds. It is a stick-and-stay mental-
ity for only 12 weeks.
When it comes to technology, friends of mine got caught up in the com-
mon mentality of “I worked out and burned 300 calories so I can have 300
more calories for the day.” As I’ve said before, this is misleading and not a
good mindset to have. I’m sure it’s why so many people are fat.
This concept is based on your BMR and your own rate of perceived exer-
tion (RPE) with exercise. Once again, I asked Copilot: “I am a pretty active
person who works out daily, how should I adjust my calories?” Here’s the
response (Microsoft, 2025):
Given your active lifestyle, you’ll need more calories than your BMR to
support your daily activities and workouts. We can use the total daily energy
expenditure (TDEE) to estimate your caloric needs. Here’s a rough calcula-
tion using the Harris-Benedict equation to find your TDEE:
For someone with high activity (working out daily), we multiply your
BMR by an activity factor. Here’s a guideline:
Week 3 | 79
• Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR x 1.2
• Lightly active (light exercise/sports one to three days a week):
BMR x 1.375
• Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports three to five days a
week): BMR x 1.55
• Very active (hard exercise/sports six to seven days a week):
BMR x 1.725
• Super active (very hard exercise, physical job, or training
twice a day): BMR x 1.9
So, to maintain your current weight at your “very active” level, you’d need
around 3,546 calories per day. Depending on your goals:
• To lose weight: Consume 500 fewer calories per day.
• To gain muscle: Consume 500 more calories per day.
Be careful not to overestimate your calorie burn during exercise. Even
if you’re a dedicated workout person, consuming 3,500 calories daily to get
lean will not work. Stick to your basic BMR numbers and adjust as needed.
This approach gives you flexibility for the occasional extra calorie, as long as
you’re mindful about sugar.
Relying on technology to track calories, you might treat yourself to a Star-
bucks mocha and a croissant rather than healthy food after you “earned” an
extra 300 calories from a workout. Don’t reward workouts with food. Instead,
use a tape measure to track progress around your waist or hips and celebrate
those shrinking inches.
I had a good laugh recently when a client’s husband, noticing his belly was
getting bigger, wrapped a tape measure around it and said, “There must be
something wrong with this tape measure.” He was serious, but then laughed,
80 | STRONG AGAIN
realizing it was a wake-up call. Tracking progress accurately can be both
enlightening and motivating.
Originally, I bought into the BMR + exercise caloric burn equation, which
suggests adding 10% of your BMR for low-intensity exercise, 20% for mod-
erate, and 30% for high intensity. But who judges workout intensity? Think-
ing you can eat extra calories without consequences can derail your diet. I’ve
tried and failed. Simplicity is easier.
In 20 years of training kids and adults, I’ve found that any beginner will
consider their workout “intense.” It’s not; it’s just that they’re unaccustomed
to proper technique. They may not feel it during the workout, but they will
the next day. Weight loss requires a caloric deficit; 3,500 calories equals one
pound. Go with results, not just science. Science needs to be repeatable, and
when it’s not, something else is at play. The one variable we control is food.
Focus on food as fuel, not comfort, and you’ll look different and feel in
control. Stick with me for nine more weeks, and you’ll look and feel your
best. Eat for your BMR without adding extra calories for exercise. I feel great
doing this, and the results speak for themselves. Save the extra calories for the
off-season. Right now, let’s get lean.
Action Steps
• Take another look at your BMR and how many calories you are
consuming (add a zero to your weight for a rough estimate)
• Move that body, get to the gym, or go for a hike
• Try to figure out how “intense” your workouts are

BALANCE
Achieving balance and hitting the 40-40-20 ratio is easy when you
have created the master plan. Eating the same thing every day will
then keep you on track. An example of a typical breakfast is simi-
lar to my dinner: four whole eggs, lean ground beef, and two pieces of dry
toast. This yields 460 calories and 40 grams of protein along with 22 grams
each of fat and carbohydrates.
The percentages for fat and protein are closer together. If you are going
day to day not knowing what you should be eating or what you should be
focusing on because you don’t have a plan, you will be out of balance the
whole day. Another, more common breakfast for me is non-fat Greek yogurt
and one scoop of protein powder mixed in. It is packed with protein (64%
of the total macronutrients), while fat is at 20% and carbs are at 16%. Both
breakfasts are awesome. But having that plan written out will determine what
to eat for your next meals.
Your next meals should fall into place based on the previous meal’s mac-
ronutrient breakdown. After a protein- and fat-rich breakfast like whole eggs
and ground beef, I will choose to eat a higher protein snack which is lower
in fat. This will keep my carbohydrates low because I like to opt for non-fat
plain Greek yogurt with protein mixed in or just a protein shake to keep my
protein high. With the second meal of the day being high protein and low
fat, I can have that apple and voila, my calories are even with a 40% protein,
40% carb, and 20% fat ratio. I use an apple as an everyday type of snack these
first four weeks or occasionally when I am hungry.
84 | STRONG AGAIN
With a master plan, you can literally see what foods you should eat more
or less of. If I take my first example and use egg whites instead of whole eggs,
it is a completely different result. Four egg whites with ground beef and two
slices of dry toast will yield 47% protein, 33% carbohydrate, and 20% fat.
Many so-called “experts” claim that eating oatmeal for breakfast is a good,
healthy option. Now, there is nothing wrong with oatmeal, but plain oat-
meal without added sugar is 13% protein, 70% carbohydrate, and 17% fat.
To achieve that ratio of 40-40-20, why not just add a scoop of protein pow-
der to make it flavored oatmeal? Just doing that will yield 40% protein, 43%
carbohydrate, and 17% fat. This will help sustain you for longer, and it is
closer to the goals we are trying to achieve with the master plan. This is great
for the first four weeks of your plan; but after this week, we will start devis-
ing the next cycle for the following four weeks.
HOW INTENSE IS YOUR INTENSE?
I’ve often wondered about how many additional calories we should eat. For
the master plan you wrote, the calories were based on your BMR without
added “intensity” calories, ensuring you’re always in a deficit and burning fat.
Remember, this is for daily activity. Your body gets efficient at those activi-
ties. For example, building a house might be tough and sweaty for a novice,
but for a seasoned carpenter, it’s just another day.
The same goes for walking. While I find walking intense due to knee and
hip pain, for mall walkers, it’s just burning the calories they would naturally
burn anyway. The benefit is that you’re not eating during those three hours.
Keeping your calories at your BMR will help burn fat because any exercise
will create a negative calorie balance.
Exercise is like food—there are tons of activities out there to help you
reach your goals. The best exercises are the ones that get you moving and hav-
ing fun. Weight training might be one of the best programs because you can
clearly see the progress you are making. Running is also great for the same
reason, but running just to lose weight is not the answer. Cardio is for your
Week 4 | 85
heart (myocardium), not just fat loss. If it looks like a duck and walks like
a duck, it may be a duck. So, when doing cardio, think about heart health
rather than just fat loss. There are better ways to do “cardio” for fat loss.
CARDIO IS FOR FAT LOSS, ISN’T IT?
HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING
I cringe when I think about my first training program for bodybuilding,
called Max OT. Mainly, because I struggled mentally despite looking great
physically. The program was simple: It involved lots of four to six reps with
heavy weights. But the interval training, or “cardio,” now called high inten-
sity interval training (HIIT), was a beast. I could only do it once a week. It
was a high incline sprint on a treadmill for up to a minute with only about
a minute rest, consecutively for 12-15 minutes total. I have tried this cardio
for a few shows and each time I had to do one-minute moderate intensity
to start and a two-minute rest because my heart and lungs were not into it.
After a few weeks you get better, then the intervals are more one minute on,
one minute off.
Mentally, I struggled with cardio. I made excuses like, “It’s going to rain,”
or, “It’s too cold.” Just thinking about it gave me a pit in my stomach. But
when you go all in, you can’t bullshit yourself. It’s a different mindset for
these 12 weeks.
I remember seeing a guy at my first show with the most shredded glutes
and back. I asked, “Holy crap, dude, what did you do for cardio?” He replied,
“I did the Max OT program.” I knew then that he nailed it. I wasn’t a slouch,
but damn, he was so shredded that cheese was jealous.
TO DO, OR NOT TO DO … CARDIO
86 | STRONG AGAIN
In contrast, I’ve done bodybuilding shows with absolutely zero cardio,
only conditioning through posing. Posing hard for 20 minutes makes you
sweat a lot as every muscle fiber in your body intensifies through contrac-
tion. For my recent show, I did some HIIT training since a friend wanted
to do a 5k run. We did cardio together in the mornings, which became a
mental getaway.
Running long distances won’t necessarily help you lose weight. Marathon
runners are incredible athletes, but their body type is different from 100- and
200-meter sprinters who are built like bodybuilders. To keep fat off, you need
to build fast twitch fibers. Running for more than two minutes primarily uses
fat as an energy source, but your body begins to store fat for future use due
to the demand for energy.
I recall an obese man completing the San Francisco marathon. Great for
him, but you rarely see an obese man sprinting 100 meters. The last time
might have been at a local softball tournament, and it looked like a sniper
got him running to first base. Find the right balance of doing cardio for your
heart and mental health, and lifting weights to chisel out those muscles that
you have been dieting so hard for.
STRING TOGETHER DAYS, THEN WEEKENDS
You need to approach your 12-week diet with the same intensity as with
weight training or cardio. For my first show, I was nervous about preparing
meals correctly. The key was to work hard and trust the process. If you string
together days and weekends, a month flies by. I used free time to snap and
steam green beans each night, or I’d just to go to bed early and do it all again
the next day. This routine taught me the “stick and stay” method.
I took part in more shows and refined my diet, but the basics remained
the same: stick to the same meals for easy calorie tracking, don’t cheat on
weekends, and hit the gym a minimum of two or three times a week to keep
Week 4 | 87
the blood flowing and muscles popping. Intensity in exercise is crucial, and
I cover this in detail in later chapters.
ALLOWING WIGGLE ROOM
Everyone is looking for a magic wand. I have one, and it is engraved with the
words consistency and effort, which will carry you through to any goal you
set. We have now set our master plan into motion and are focused. This is
the last week following this plan until our next four-week micro cycle. Let’s
talk about allowing wiggle room.
I shouldn’t even open this can of worms. I have a food list for a reason:
to stop me going astray. Don’t be tempted. If you don’t trust yourself, stick
with the same thing every single day for 12 weeks. Anyone that has stepped
on stage for the first time will tell you the same. It is so nerve-racking not
being sure of yourself that it is best to stick to the program.
STICK TO THE PLAN, TRUST THE
PROCESS, ACHIEVE THE RESULTS
You must push to the extremes to see what your body can do. My very
first diet I was eating egg whites and broccoli for breakfast, eight scoops of
protein shake throughout the day spaced out between meals, and three meals
with 4oz of chicken. Vegetables were also in there, but I didn’t count those as
calories. I usually kept my protein to around 240g, carbs under 60-75g, and
fats under 50g per day. If you add those calories up it is around 1,700. My
first show I was so nervous I stayed under my BMR.
After doing the same thing for 12 weeks and getting the results I wanted
for the show, the next show I dabbled. I wondered if I could eat popcorn for
some extra carbs at night because I wasn’t eating any bread while maintain-
ing a strict, protein-centric eating plan. It was delicious, and a game changer.
Then life hit me and I needed quicker meals so protein bars got into the mix.
88 | STRONG AGAIN
The nutrition labels are easier to read and some taste good. Now, I didn’t have
to just drink all my protein shakes; I could eat some bars between clients and
on the go. Be careful not to keep them in your car on a hot day though, you
will be licking the bar out of the wrapper.
Consistency is key when losing weight. I’ve found that veering off the
plan wildly for just a day can delay progress for up to three days. During
prep for my third bodybuilding show, I gave in to a candy dish of M&Ms at
my cousin’s house. I ate the whole family-sized bag. For three days, I could
see inflammation and water retention around my belly button. I was disap-
pointed but realized how crucial consistency is. As an all-or-nothing person,
I believe a 12-week plan to get shredded is perfect for maintaining control
and ensuring progress.
CONSISTENCY IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN PERFECTION
Staying consistent is key, but you can give yourself some latitude with
meals. Focus on lean protein sources, whether meat or plant-based, that are
low in carbs, moderate in fat, and high in protein. If you need variety, opt for
a piece of fish or steak instead of chicken. Occasionally, you can have a larger
portion, like an 18oz steak dinner, but only once every three to four weeks
for these extreme moves. Regular lateral moves, like switching 4oz of chicken
for eye of round steak, are fine since the macros are similar. Just avoid mak-
ing those 18oz steak dinners a frequent habit, and take your spouse out for
dinner to enjoy a night off meal prep.
In extreme cases like birthdays, graduations, or retirement parties, the fat,
carb, and protein contents can be similar but the portions are larger. Focus
on vegetables at these events. If there are veggie or fruit platters, stick to them.
At one party, I had zero pizza; and, at another, I had two brats without the
bun. My extended family loves potluck meals, so the meat from sloppy joes
Week 4 | 89
was my main course. These events aren’t every weekend, so allow some wig-
gle room but prioritize protein. Still hungry? Eat more protein.
With carbohydrates, focus on the main macronutrient content and avoid
sugar. Just like my M&Ms example, sugar causes problems. A great lateral
move is popcorn. I love it with a few tablespoons of Bertolli’s virgin olive
oil instead of butter. It tastes amazing with salt and is a family favorite. This
might be my go-to treat for the next micro cycle as the diet gets stricter. You
get healthy fats and a good carb source if you need a snack.
Lateral moves for carbs can be half a cup of oatmeal or rice instead of two
pieces of bread. A sweet potato or sweet potato fries are great for a weekend
change up or snack. Sometimes, I will eat corn on the cob without the butter as
a side for a weekend meal. It all comes down to basic, whole food carbohydrates.
Writing out your master plan will show you what your ratio is for carbs
and protein. It is super easy to overeat carbs; that is why you need to focus
on protein first. If your carbs are climbing up the calorie ladder, it is time to
put in some protein shakes. I like to focus on having carbs once a day—either
a piece of fruit or an egg sandwich—but everything else is protein focused.
The carbs, as you will see, kind of take care of themselves.
Fats are packed with energy and can stave off hunger for long periods if
you eat healthy ones. Adding olive oil to your rice and chicken is a great start.
However, fatty foods can quickly increase your calorie intake. There’s a big
difference between ground beef and ground turkey at 80%, 85%, and 93%
lean. For the first four weeks, I use 85% lean beef and mix up taco bowls with
beef, salsa, and Greek yogurt. They’re delicious, and I eat them almost daily.
If I want variety, I wrap it in a tortilla and call it a taco—super easy, simple,
and packed with fat-burning properties.
Plan your macronutrients for the whole day. Your master plan should aim
for a 40-40-20 ratio of protein, carbs, and fats. Write it out to see what to eat
and when. Focus on the whole picture for the day instead of lurching from
meal to meal. Focus on each day, not just each meal. One day will roll into
the next, until you’re standing on the podium looking jacked as hell.
90 | STRONG AGAIN
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF
If you tell me you need to lose weight and I give you diet advice, what’s
your response? “I had this or that for dinner.” Okay, but what about lunch or
breakfast? Often, people highlight the one healthy thing they ate and ignore
the rest. “I had a beer because it was a long day,” or, “I had a bite of pumpkin
pie for my wife’s birthday.” Are you even on a diet? That mindset will keep
you stagnant. If this sounds like you, you need to stick to the same thing every
day, all the time. Quit lying to yourself and put in the work.
My last example is my cousin doing the Jamie Eason diet, popular around
2008-10. She lost a ton of weight after having two kids, sticking to Jamie’s
plan and meals, and achieved her goal. But like with most diets, she gained
it back when life got busy. I don’t fault her for it; she knows how to get back
there. She once said, “I know how to get skinny again, but I don’t want to
work that hard again.” At least she owns it. We need to love people where
they are, but you need to focus to get there in the first place.
Shoot, as a coach, when I say “last one,” it rarely is. Take my mom, for
example. As a kid, I remember her trying on blouses at a department store
and coming out in tears because nothing fit. It felt awful seeing her cry, just
like when I took coins from her butter dish to buy candy and later saw her
crying at the bank because she didn’t have enough money from waitressing.
I want you to be happy with where you are. I’m here to help. This plan
is for you to follow, not just try. If you’ve ever looked in the mirror and felt
stuck or unsure about getting lean, here’s your answer. This plan isn’t for me;
it’s for you.
I have an affinity for helping people. Sometimes, I care more than you do.
I can give you the tools to succeed. But it’s up to you to do the work.
When I was young in the business, I trained a high-level executive who
struggled with breathlessness, always blaming her breathing. I told her, “It’s
not because you’re out of breath, it’s because you’re out of shape.” She was
Week 4 | 91
going through a lot—divorce, running a business, and immense stress. Our
heart-to-heart meetings often ended in tears, reminding me of my mom. I
want you to succeed, but you have to put in the effort. It’s up to you.

PROGRESSING YOUR EXERCISE ROUTINES
No matter where you are in your fitness journey, it’s a good start.
Whether you’re a couch potato, workaholic, or always helping others,
that energy has potential. Now that you’re diving into a nutrition pro-
gram, it’s time to step it up a notch. Progression doesn’t have to be grueling.
I get anxious about doing a one-mile run, wanting to beat my college
time of six minutes and 32 seconds at 245lbs. I know how it feels afterward—
barely able to breathe with lungs tasting of blood. The anxiety stems from
wanting to be as good as I once was, but knowing it’ll hurt. But the mindset
must shift to progress and improvement, not self-destruction. Just running
at a leisurely pace is a win for me because I wouldn’t have done it otherwise.
Many people feel anxious about weight training. I love lifting and believe
the best way to progress in the gym is not just to do heavy weights or lots of
reps but to show up every time. That’s the first step. In my years of training, I’ve
done many programs focusing on strength, power, pump, flexibility, circuits,
supersets, drop sets, rest-pause, tempo training, chains, bands, boards, boxes,
machines—any of these can be a perfect progression from what you did before.
SAME WORKOUTS, SAME RESULTS?
Are you still stuck doing the 3x10 reps like it’s the ’80s? Nowadays, it
seems fitness influencers on TikTok and Instagram have replaced traditional
96 | STRONG AGAIN
athletes. They rely on radical exercises for attention, but you rarely see the
hard work behind the scenes.
I had the chance to go backstage as an intern therapist to a WWE event
in Milwaukee. Seeing athletes like John Cena, Dave Bautista, Triple H, and
The Undertaker was amazing. There were treatment rooms, locker rooms, and
coordination officers, all working behind the scenes. I got in trouble for try-
ing to snap a picture with my flip phone. John Cena himself closed my phone
and said, “Hey, no pictures.” It was a lesson in respecting their private space.
Everyone sees what happens through the camera’s lens when they are on
stage, but unless you are putting the work in behind the scenes, you have no clue.
STICK WITH WHAT YOU LIKE
When you lift weights, you break down muscle tissue, which helps build more
muscle and boosts metabolism. Running burns calories and helps mentally.
Your body adapts in three to four weeks to such new stresses. These activities
then become part of your “BMR bucket,” burning no extra calories.
Instead of a 3x10 workout plan for six exercises in 45 minutes, try super-
sets for the next four weeks, finishing in 25 minutes. This leaves time for flex-
ibility, cardio, or new exercises. A basic beginner workout with straight sets
is good for busy gyms where you can’t use multiple pieces of equipment. If
you can plan your workouts to use the same piece of equipment for two exer-
cises, you can now do supersets, helping build stamina and cardio. Transi-
tioning from four weeks of straight sets with more repetitions to four weeks
of supersets improves both strength and cardio. The first two weeks will be a
challenge to adjust, with more soreness, but you’ll see progress.
Progression doesn’t mean changing your workouts completely. In my pro-
gramming, I use similar exercises to build reps, weight, or endurance. Most
adults get bored quickly, which is why sports like CrossFit can be popular.
CrossFit changes constantly, but that’s not progression—it’s “muscle confu-
sion.” And your brain might also get confused as to why your marriage is on
the rocks. Zing! LOL.
Week 5 | 97
As with the rest of the diet, we progress throughout the four weeks. It’s
not about switching from one fast food joint to another; it’s about cutting
sugar and making better protein choices. In weight training, don’t go from
dumbbell bench press to renegade rows and think it’s a good progression.
Both stimulate muscle growth but not in the same way. You want results, so
progress smarter.
Training athletes has helped me progress their athletic ability by learning
movements. With effective coaching, you can create a stimulus and improve
in four weeks, then add a new stimulus by changing the movement. Exercises
are about movements, not just muscles. The first few weeks of exercises work
on adapting to the new stimulus, but changing the movements creates new
adaptations. For easily bored adults, exercises can change each week. While I
try to include some progression, just getting them to exercise is already a win.
MANY WAYS TO “SKIN A CAT”
Besides changing exercises, there are many ways to progress your work -
outs: shortening rest intervals, adding reps or sets, and tempo training, to
name a few. The main goal is to get to the gym and start.
Recently, I picked up a tip from John Meadows, a well-known strength
coach and podcaster. He said, “If you can hit 60 reps, the weight is too light.”
In the first week, I managed 3x40 on the bench press with 135lbs. By week
two, I pushed myself to reach 60 reps each set. It was fun to see what my
body could do.
Does it fit perfectly into a 12-week strength plan? Maybe not, but it was
enjoyable. If you’re not having fun, why are you doing it?
FOCUSING ON PROTEIN
We have just completed the first micro cycle of our 12-week plan: four weeks
focused on cleaning up the diet with less sugar, fewer cheat meals, and more
98 | STRONG AGAIN
sensible eating overall. Many people fall into one of two patterns (I see it all
the time). The first group looks the same because they’re still fooling them-
selves with cheat meals—sharing one clean meal they ate while conveniently
leaving out the rest. Be honest with yourself. The second group, however, is
already seeing progress by sticking closely to the plan, making consistent
choices, and avoiding unnecessary slip-ups. For my part, over these first four
weeks, I’ll openly share where I’ve stumbled along the way.
• The first week I am always locked in and good to go, then comes
the weekend. The first weekend I had a slice of pizza at a friend’s
house and two drinks. The other mis-step was I didn’t prepare my
foods as well so I relied on beef jerky from gas stations quite a bit
and protein bars. But this is the norm for me with any diet I start.
I did, however, cut out all butter on bread, dressings on salads, and
focused more on whole foods like eggs and beef for dinner. Over-
all, I give it a 95% compliance rating for following my master plan.
• Week 2, my only cheat was that I took my kids to a local baseball
game. I had half a hot dog and a plain chicken sandwich. I enjoyed
some peanuts too, which I included in my master plan as olive oil
(a lateral move for my fats).
• Week 3 and Week 4 I shifted more towards rice, beef, and chicken,
so I went a little gonzo on protein bars. The problem is I buy dif-
ferent kinds, and to me they are delicious so I overeat them. And
being in the first four weeks, I always tend to overeat my bigger
meals as I know the calorie restriction is just around the corner.
Week 3 was when I also had that 18oz ribeye steak for a nice din-
ner out. It was delicious. I had the same one for my last show so
to me, it will help me stay jacked. Lol.
There are my cheat meals for the first four weeks. I do popcorn at night
for cravings. Recently, I ate half a bag of seasoned pretzel twists at a friend’s
Week 5 | 99
house, justifying it by saying, “Oh, it doesn’t have much sugar.” Be honest
with yourself. I didn’t care that I ate the pretzels because I have a protein-
first mentality. Trust me, I wanted a cocktail or more pizza, but I chose the
lesser evil. These cheats are okay occasionally if you control the rest of your
diet. The problem arises when cheats happen every few days, halting progress.
DON’T FOCUS ON THE SCALES
How are you looking right now? Don’t focus on the scales; your weight
won’t change much after the first week. The next four weeks is where it gets
fun. Cheating needs to stop. A small cheat like a bag of pretzels is okay, but
avoid pastries, baked goods, and other sugary treats—they’re hard to recover
from. If this is your first 12-week diet, no cheating is allowed.
We need a new master plan for the next four weeks. Keeping it simple and
sticking to it without cheating is key. During the next phase of the master plan
I shift from eating lots of protein bars to eating more beef and chicken. I’m
also adding more vegetables, and we need to discuss those. The goal of creat-
ing this plan is to be closer to the 40% protein, 40% carb and 20% fat ratios.
I shoot above the 40% protein ratios on my master plan to create wiggle
room. I have 55% protein, 25% carbohydrates and 20% fat. As we discussed
earlier, changing these ratios can be as simple as having one less protein drink
and one more apple each day. Sticking to the plan as best you can will create
that fat-burning environment you want for your body.
VEGETABLES
Vegetables can be considered “negative” calorie foods. Not all are the same,
but chicken and broccoli is a classic for a reason. Broccoli is a great vegetable,
whether raw or cooked. I like it with salt. Be cautious with carrots and toma-
toes; they’re fine occasionally but not daily. Stick to veggies that help you stay
lean. Cauliflower is good but causes gas, which can be intense.
100 | STRONG AGAIN
VEGETABLES CAN BE USEFUL
TO HELP STAVE HUNGER
By adding a fibrous fruit like an apple, your daily sugar rises. Is that your
only main source of sugar throughout the day? It should be. An apple a day
may keep the doctor away if you can follow this plan. But you should remem-
ber this corny line (forgive the forced rhyme!): If you have a high sugar diet
and repeat this, you will get diabetes.
The first show I did I was very strict, and I would be so bored at night I
would sit on the couch with an apple and a knife after prepping my food for
the next day. I would slowly peel the apple and take small bites just to savor
it for longer. So having that apple every day if you need it is not a problem,
as long as you stick to the rest of the diet.
BE MINDFUL OF MISLEADING MARKETING
AND CAREFUL WITH PROTEIN SOURCES
Right now, I am teaching my kids the phrase “this can go south really
quick.” It came up at bath time a few days ago. Three kids in a bath not want-
ing to get out, that phrase is inevitable.
Dieting can certainly be a mental marathon. Staying strict for days only to
feel derailed by one slip-up can be discouraging. It’s like starting from scratch
with each stumble, which can wear down even the most determined spir-
its. The overwhelming amount of information and differing advice out there
doesn’t make it easier. Maybe you are doing well, and then you start intro-
ducing sugars and different fruits. An example is a fruit smoothie. You meet
a girlfriend for lunch or you are feeling extra healthy so you get smoothie.
There is a lot of sugar in that stuff, even though people will use the excuse,
“But it is natural sugar.”
Week 5 | 101
If you have a fruit smoothie for lunch, you might feel fuller than usual
and skip your next meal. Increasing your sugar intake can reduce calories
throughout the day because you will most likely skip meals, which doesn’t
help with fat loss. It’s like overeating at dinner and then skipping breakfast
because you’re still full. This is terrible for fat loss and only leads to weight
gain. If you deviate from your plan, get back on track ASAP or things will
go south fast.
Nine times out of 10, we crave snacks at night. Knowing I want popcorn
for a snack after dinner, I will not have a tortilla with my egg-white burrito.
This change brings my ratios closer to the 40-40-20 balance.
This can vary day to day, but the key is keeping sugars low and prioritizing
protein. The first four weeks focused on clean eating with more fat and pro-
tein than carbs. Carbs are fine as long as we prioritize protein and keep sug-
ars low. Now, we need to focus on leaner foods to keep calories around our
BMR. To stave off hunger and keep you excited, we introduce “carb cycling.”
PROTEIN FIRST; BUT NOW CARBOHYDRATES?
FOCUSING ON MORE CARBS FOR ONE DAY
Carb cycling is something that I have always tried to do over the past 12 to
15 years while powerlifting and strongman training, but never for bodybuild-
ing. For bodybuilders, carbs seemed bad. Carbohydrates as a whole are not
the problem, but certain ones are.
Carb cycling involves alternating between high-carb and low-carb days
to match your energy levels and needs. It helps support muscle growth and
enhance fat loss. Carbs are stored in your muscle as glycogen, and when you
have intense workout sessions, more carbs will be utilized for packing on mus-
cle. If, that is, you are more sensitive to insulin.
During my powerlifting and strongman days, I wanted to stay lean but
also get super strong. My idea of carb cycling was to eat a ton of calories
102 | STRONG AGAIN
and basically whatever I wanted, i.e., pizza and donuts, on my super heavy
and intense days. Splurging on these days and trying to eat a cleaner diet on
the other days does not last that long because you crave those crappy foods.
I would wake up inflamed and swollen from eating like shit and having a
heavy training day, skip breakfast, and then just eat whatever was available
for lunch, like left-over pizza.
It is not a real training diet, more like how students eat at college or many
people do when they let themselves go in their 30s, then look in the mirror
and think, Shit, what happened?
I’ve had many clients like this who have confided in me and broken down
because they do not know where to turn. They needed this diet, plain and
simple. They have become so insulin resistant their body doesn’t care whether
they eat garbage because it just packs it in storage.
INSULIN SENSITIVITY
Insulin is such a powerful hormone that bodybuilders in the pro rankings
will use it to pack on extra size and strength. When my buddy Andrew and
I were training together, we just wanted to get jacked. He is also a firefighter
and deals with all sorts of people on his calls. We got on to the subject of
insulin and how jacked we could get. But you can also get very dead. And not
as in cancer years later, but dead in minutes. I am glad to know people like
Andrew. He gave me a dose of reality among all these influencers and body-
builders on stage promoting one thing but not sharing what they really do.
You need to think critically about how they got to that point. I am not
saying don’t do this or do use that, but you definitely need to find the right
resources. Unfortunately, in my experience it isn’t any local doctor. My only
advice on this subject is don’t go digging through grandma and grandpa’s
medicine cabinet for insulin. You do not know what you are doing, and my
buddy Andrew could soon be coming to your house to save your ass.
Week 5 | 103
Insulin is produced by the pancreas. That is an organ that we often forget
about until someone in our family is diabetic and starts talking about their
A1C levels. Honestly, I didn’t know what that was until my neighbor started
talking about it 15 years ago. And now, of course, I see nothing but commer-
cials about A1C levels. I just remember the guy with the cowboy hat talking
about his “diabeetus” when I was growing up.
USE CARBS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
Insulin sensitivity refers to how effectively your body’s cells respond to
insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. High insulin sensitivity means
your body responds well to insulin, allowing carbs and sugars to enter cells
efficiently, keeping blood sugars stable. Low insulin sensitivity, or insulin resis-
tance, occurs when your body becomes less responsive to insulin, often due
to poor diet. This means your muscle cells aren’t optimally absorbing carbs,
leading the body to store excess glucose as fat.
Carb cycling for the sake of it is a slippery slope. I couldn’t effectively do it
during my other forms of training, but with bodybuilding I could. Why the
change? Because I planned out my days. For these next four weeks we need
to come up with a master plan of keeping our carbs low so we can include a
high-carb day for our carb cycling. This will give us the necessary energy for
intense workouts and to still grow. On the other days we have less carbs, we
need to be in the mindset of a fat-burning machine. The low-carb days help
promote fat burning by reducing our insulin levels. Focusing on carb cycling
will ensure metabolic flexibility, helping our bodies adapt to using both carbs
and fats as efficient fuel sources.
Picking what types of carbs to eat is up to you. If you are dedicated to
sticking with your master plan and focusing on heavy training days, you
need good carbohydrates and a lot of them. This can be rice, potato, bread,
bagels … things with lower sugar. I usually eat these items plain (without
104 | STRONG AGAIN
butter) just because I am trying to keep my overall calories low. There are
many ways to carb cycle effectively, but, ultimately, for me it came down to
when I had time to eat, and it was usually at night. Probably not the best,
but that’s what I did.
CARBS JUST BEFORE WORKOUTS
The rule of thumb for carbs is to eat them shortly before your workout.
For me, Thursday is my high-carb day. After a 12-hour workday, I grab sushi
and a pack of bagels or Ezekial bread from the grocery store. I eat the sushi on
the drive home and then have bagels or bread until bedtime. After six hours
of sleep, I eat the rest of my carbs before hitting the gym. It works for me.
When powerlifting, I followed a master diet plan but allowed anything
on high-carb days. But I know I can’t do that if I want to get super lean. I’d
crave donuts and pizza, leading to breakdowns. If you cheat on weekends,
it’s not a diet; it’s a lifestyle. Knowing you shouldn’t eat cookies and not eat-
ing them are totally different.
Remember, after a week of low carbs, your body is craving them. Add in
carbs for the one day each week that you have a hard training session and
you will see the results and vascularity the next.
PLAN YOUR CARB DAY
On my high carb day, I try to keep my meals similar with the exception
of switching out rice as my preferred carb for protein. I love sushi and I will
almost always have that on my high carb day. I don’t have this on my food
list, so I used calorieking.com to work out the rough calories for something
comparable. I skip the sauces and tempura sushi on these cycles. I also enjoy
bagels for my higher carbs, which are not on the list either. Looking bagels
Week 5 | 105
up on calorieking.com, bagels are closer to rice than bread, so I added that
as a substitute. When you become a good label reader, you will see which
bagels you should buy. I opt for the ones lower in sugar and around 1,000
calories for the whole bag. Plain bagels taste great when you haven’t had sugar
for the past four weeks.
This brings up another point: nutrient timing. Ideally, most of your carbs
should be around your workouts. My timing isn’t perfect for muscle growth,
but it was for my last show when I implemented carb cycling. It’s ultimately
about how you look and feel. If you carb load on Thursday but eat poorly on
Saturday, you’re not really carb cycling; you are stagnating.
Intermittent fasting can be similar; some people only follow it when con-
venient, but abandon it on weekends. Is that really fasting or just being undis-
ciplined? For my last show, I did a bagel/sushi carb cycle and felt amazing. I
plan to continue this, though I know I should have my carbs post-workout
on Friday. If I carb load on Thursday, I don’t count Friday as a carb day, and
I don’t want Friday to be my heavy carb day since I usually don’t train on
weekends. It’s a mental battle, but you must find what works for you.
I reach around 354 grams on my high carbohydrate days. Pretty high
considering I want them around 100 grams. Sugars are another key factor to
look at, and they are only at 13.7 grams. Crazy low! The calories are high, and
this would be an optimal Thursday for me. But remember the wiggle room.
I put all the bagels (as rice) on the dinner menu. And if my day is super busy
I may have to skip a snack, bringing those calories back down to 2,300. It is
amazing how you can play with calories when you know what and how you
should be eating.
Wednesday is my longest day in the gym as I don’t get home until about 8
pm. Therefore, I use Wednesday as my low-carb day to get my muscles hun-
gry for Thursday’s higher carbs. Having this balance of calories throughout
the day, even though it is only 1,500, does not leave you starving. The goal
of this day is to really crank up burning fat as you hardly have any carbs or
fat in you.
106 | STRONG AGAIN
To stay with a low-carb day, I look at the food list and see what is low in
fat and carbs and high in protein: skinless chicken breast, protein powders,
egg whites, and a meal replacement are my go-tos. If at any point I am hun-
gry, I have no problem adding in an extra shake or two for this day.
This method of carb cycling helps prevent your metabolism from being
sluggish. This ramps up your fat and carb burning capabilities while really
forcing the protein to be used as an energy source on those low-calorie days.
This program can be flexible according to your schedule. Write it out so you
have a plan. On your non-training days, the focus should be on lower calo-
ries and less carbohydrates. The weekends are like this for me, and trust me, it
is hard if you are sitting around not doing anything, so get out and be active.
And when you are this strict on the weekends, when you go to parties during
this phase it is important to really stick to the vegetable trays and eat before
you go. Yes, you can get away with having fruit and some meat, but you really
need to be conscious of what you are eating.
Of course, all this can go out the window; if you are not comfortable with
carb cycling, don’t do it. I couldn’t cope mentally with it when I did my first
show. I was so nervous about losing weight and checking the mirror I still
felt fat two weeks before the show. Having learnt about my body and gone
through the process, I know better and more effective diet programs. But
the key is consistency.

IDENTIFY YOUR COMMON STRESSORS
In this chapter, as for every week of the diet, our focus remains on staying
the course. When we stray, we must swiftly correct our path during these
12 weeks. Identifying our common stressors is crucial—it affects how we
look and feel. If you can’t pinpoint those stressors, perhaps winging it with
your nutrition isn’t the best approach. Consistency is the secret sauce for any
successful diet. Let’s explore why you might—or might not—stay consistent.
ADDRESSING STRESSORS WILL
MAINTAIN LONG-TERM SUCCESS
Everyone is wired differently and programmed through their successes,
failures, and observations of others. I have always been an observer, which to
many may seem surprising. I am usually the loudest in the room and want
everyone’s attention, but not at first.
This is a learned behavior because I am the youngest of three siblings. If
my brother got in trouble, he would get spanked or yelled at and I would
learn not to do what he did! Yet, most of the time, we were both in the wrong
and we both got in trouble. The same goes for reading a room when there
is a party. You can be that pompous guy that metaphorically beats his chest
and pretends he owns the place, or just sit back, get a feel for everything, and
then pick and choose who you want to talk to because of shared interests.
110 | STRONG AGAIN
At family get-togethers when I was little, I gravitated to my older cousin
Vinnie who was into weight training and getting jacked. But as soon as he
started talking 4x4 trucks and diesel engines with the other cousins I had to
dip out. I was more of a Star Wars and DC/Marvel universe-type guy and just
felt dumb nodding my head pretending I got it. When I was young, my dad
would yell at me for how I filled the car with gas. I remember getting gas at
the local station and being confused when my dad said “put 87 in there.” I
asked, “Dad, I don’t know what 87 is, don’t you use unleaded?” So, getting
yelled at for minor things growing up and seeing the results of other’s mis-
takes engrained in me to be timid at first, then grow.
If you have never done a bodybuilding show before, or truly stuck to a
diet, this is where you are at. You may think you know what you are doing
and can have a cheat here and there, but you will fizzle out faster than a ’90s
boyband. The best advice I’ve ever gotten was to stick with the same foods
and keep it easy. Find the reward in the mundane. It may feel boring and it
will occasionally suck, but, in the end, it will be a blessing because you will
learn so much, not only about dieting and nutrition, but about your own
mental prowess.
STICK WITH THE SAME FOODS
TO KEEP THE DIET EASY
Beginning any type of diet or exercise program, or even a project at home,
involves some timidity. You don’t just wake up one day and think, I am going
to tackle the septic system and build a new one by hand. For one thing, it is prob-
ably illegal in today’s world, and for another, where do you start? So many
people look at other options and shortcuts when they begin. That is a huge
problem in today’s world because of Instagram and TikTok. Everyone is a
self-proclaimed expert, and they will give you advice on this or that, but the
real secret is coming from a paid subscription or something they are selling.
Week 6 | 111
My graduate college coach, John Grogan, said it best when he said, “Why
do you think there are so many magazine articles explaining diet and exer-
cise? If you have one diet that works for everyone, you would never have to
buy another magazine again, so they keep pumping out more crap infor-
mation to keep you buying more and more magazines.” And this was 2002
when there was no such thing as social media. It amazes me how many kids
come into the gym trying to work out barefoot, or in slides so they can hit
the shower as soon as they’re done. Then they sit there doing the latest exer-
cise they saw on Instagram that made Ronnie Coleman super-jacked or Chris
Bumsted super-ripped.
“EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A BODYBUILDER, BUT
NOBODY WANTS TO LIFT THIS HEAVY ASS WEIGHT”
—RONNIE COLEMAN
No, it was the hard ass work they put in at the gym. If you want to be
successful at this, don’t look around social media for the answers as you will
get inundated with dumb shit. Look at the shredded guy in the corner not
really talking to anyone, just doing his own thing. He or she will most likely
help you out, and just a few words of advice from them can turn your life
around. It isn’t a secret, just consistency and effort. They most likely keep
themselves to themselves because they are on a mission to get jacked. In their
head, they are that little boy or girl trying to prove something to someone,
even if it evolved to proving it to themselves. Don’t get sucked into the hype.
SOCIAL PRESSURES
How many times have you heard, “Oh come on, it is just one bite”? The new
favorite assumption going around is “Ozempic?” or “are you on the shot?”
when they see you have lost a lot of weight. People used to assume it was
either divorce or cancer.
112 | STRONG AGAIN
Being at social events can be troublesome for people who are just starting
on their mission to take control of their diet. No one will ever question if you
are drinking too much or eating too much, but the second you tell people
you are on a diet they are like, “Oooohhhh, why? You look great!”
Dieting is a mental challenge, and our support network might uninten-
tionally make it tougher. Friends mean well but don’t always share honest
feedback about weight changes, fearing they might hurt your feelings. Thus,
we may remain unaware of subtle changes in our body.
To combat this, taking regular progress photos of yourself, even in your
underwear, can be invaluable. It’s not about vanity; it’s about having a clear
visual reference of your journey. These pictures will serve as a personal reminder
of why you embarked on this goal in the first place and will help you stay
motivated. Seeing your progress can be a powerful motivator, keeping you
on track even when the scale might not show the whole story.
Remember, the journey to health and fitness is personal, and it’s okay to
assess yourself honestly through these photos. Keep pushing forward and cel-
ebrate every small victory along the way!
FOCUS ON YOUR GOALS, EVEN WHEN OTHERS
DON’T UNDERSTAND YOUR JOURNEY
I used my first bodybuilding show as an escape to not have to deal with
my relationship issues and workload. Plus, when Ronnie Coleman is the guest
poser it is time to shit or get off the pot.
Over the next few shows, I received some hurtful comments from friends
and relatives. I don’t know if they realized they were having such a negative effect
when they said things like, “I liked you better when you were fat,” or, “When
can you be normal again?” It is like offering a drink to a recovering alcoholic.
And it really is so much fun when everyone knows you are dieting yet
they are still stuffing their faces in front of you. Their look says, Don’t judge
Week 6 | 113
me. Occasionally I will still get people asking, “Why don’t you just eat this?”
I always respond with “because I have goals.” And just leave it at that. That
line usually makes the other person feel bad because they don’t have any
goals. Or, you help them by making them realize and reflect on the fact they
don’t have any.
TIME MANAGEMENT
Balancing work, family, and fitness is a tough gig. Training my clients early in
the morning and late into the evening for the past 20 years has made me real-
ize you need to set time away for yourself. This is just “you” time, and that’s it.
During my college days, I carefully managed my time. As a budding foot-
ball and track athlete, I wanted to hit the gym early on Fridays so that I could
party and still be in bed early enough to train on Saturday mornings. I’d start
my workouts at 5 am before classes. This left my Friday afternoons free for
kicking things off and getting to house parties. I vividly remember manning
the keg—those nights brought out both the best and the worst in me. And,
believe it or not, it took me a while to realize that most girls don’t head out
until 10 or 11 pm. As a country bumpkin who rose with the sun, that late-
night scene was a whole different world!
Growing up on the farm taught me to be task-oriented. Whatever the
chore, there was a clear sequence: For turning hay into bales, for example, it
was cut, rake, and bale. Rain was our nemesis—we hoped it wouldn’t delay
the process. On the farm, multitasking meant cutting hay in the morning,
feeding cows in the afternoon, raking the dried field, milking cows, and then
operating the baler. Long days, but everything had a system.
During college summers, I balanced work and training. Early mornings
were for chores, followed by lifting sessions at my old high school, then back
to the farm. Prioritizing my workouts was key. Even with 15-16 hour work-
days, I made sure to get my lifting in.
During graduate school at North Dakota State studying athletic admin-
istration and doing a graduate assistantship job as a strength coach, I had
114 | STRONG AGAIN
less time to work out. I had to come in before the kids started showing up
for their training programs. I moved from one day per week to five doing
workouts at 5 am.
MAKE TIME FOR YOUR HEALTH
After completing grad school, I landed my first “real” job as a personal
trainer in a one-on-one studio near Milwaukee. It was quite a transition—
from college life with sports and parties to the juggling act of working as a
graduate assistant strength coach and focusing on grad school. Suddenly, I
found myself in a typical eight-hour workday, which felt foreign after my
previous experiences.
But what to do after my 2 pm shift? Well, I stuck with my morning work-
out routine and decided to dive into something new: Tae Kwon Do. Martial
arts have always intrigued me, and this was my chance to explore them. And
guess what? Some of my clients from those early days still train with me today!
During the summer months, my focus shifted from martial arts to train-
ing the kids at the gym. It’s the busiest time for any sports performance cen-
ter—the incoming kids finally have a break in their schedules, and I was there
to help as many as I could throughout the day.
After earning my black belt at 26, I explored other activities like Muay
Thai, MMA, strongman, and powerlifting. My mornings were still dedicated
to lifting, and I tailored my workouts for these different events. The only
exception? Summers, when my attention shifted to those eager young athletes.
DON’T SACRIFICE SLEEP
I rise at 2:45 am, hitting the gym by 3:30 am. Initially, it was 4 am, but an
intern’s early arrival motivated me to reclaim that early bird status. By 9 pm,
Week 6 | 115
I’m ready for bed. Now, here’s the thing about sleep: It’s crucial. Rather than
sacrificing it, consider shifting your sleep patterns. Even if you go to bed at
1 am and wake up at 8 am, those seven hours matter. And guess what? Start-
ing a clean diet often leads to less grogginess, improved sleep quality, no acid
reflux, and way less snoring.
EARLY RISER, RELENTLESS GRINDER
Discovering your optimal training time and maintaining consistency
are crucial. When you’re a frequent traveler, seek out hotel gyms immedi-
ately. No gym? No problem— don’t focus on gym workouts and put your
focus on bodyweight exercises and walks if you can, but most importantly
plan your meals as that is the true determinant of weight loss. Whether it’s
work meetings or a family vacation, being prepared sets you up for success.
You might become that early riser annoying everyone by having everything
ready, but secretly, they’re grateful. It’s like those “friends” urging you to
“just have one bite”—they’re just jealous that you’re taking charge of your
fitness journey.
PLATEAUS AND LACK OF PROGRESS
This week you may want to hop on the scales if you haven’t already. Just be
ready to be disappointed. You most likely haven’t seen any weight loss since
the first week when you lost the water weight. But what you will notice is
the transformation you are going through. Everyone else around you will
notice it too, but, like most people, you want more. It’s crucial to stick to
the plan for these next few weeks because you will then feel like you are just
shedding the pounds.
Hitting a plateau can be hard in anything we do: weight training, rela-
tionships, and dieting all come to mind. Weight training is difficult because
unless you progressively overload, you are doing the same thing all the time.
116 | STRONG AGAIN
But at least you are doing something. Even if that’s helping you mentally
rather than physically, it is worth it.
In bodybuilding, you want to see progress on stage and in the real world.
You want your suit jacket to have that athletic cut or those arms to be shapely
in that dress. You want people to notice. Using progressive overload will help
build that lean muscle we are looking for so people will notice that hard work
you have been putting in.
I have a 67-year-old female friend who’s on a perpetual roller coaster when
it comes to dieting. Recently, she shed another 80 pounds after a decade of
life’s stresses. She looks fantastic, but our approach to weight training doesn’t
involve heavy progressive overload; we focus on reps and rest. Weight loss
is her goal, and she’s content with it. However, when she hits a plateau, she
tends to crank up the weight training, which often leads to trouble. The result?
Injuries, burnout, and achy knees.
Is it worth getting anxious over a lack of results? No, but this is where
you’ve got to stay true to yourself. I’ve got this client, 64 years old, who claims
he’s joining me in a bodybuilding show. But here’s the deal: You’re either in
or out. Don’t be that guy who talks a big game for the first two weeks and
then vanishes into thin air, who everyone realizes has been sneaking cheat
meals and can’t stay consistent.
Yesterday, he drops this on me: Some influencer told him, “Don’t believe
anyone who promises to transform you in 12 or 16 weeks; they’re just after your
wallet.” I couldn’t help but chuckle. Guess what? This same influencer was ped-
dling a year-long bodybuilding program. Talk about a masterclass in scamming.
Look, results take time. Consistency, discipline, and a protein shake or
two—that’s the real recipe. Either flex those muscles or fade into the back-
ground. Your choice. If you have been doing the work, keeping up with the
diet, and not lying to yourself, you will see results. It is that simple. If you
haven’t even taken the first step of writing down what you have eaten over
the last three days, you are not ready to diet and will continue your lifestyle
while telling everyone you are on a diet. You are only fooling yourself.
Week 6 | 117
CONSISTENCY AND HONESTY ARE YOUR BEST
ALLIES ON THE JOURNEY TO TRANSFORMATION
MENTAL RESILIENCE
To me, mental toughness is being able to push through those hard times in
life. It doesn’t mean having no empathy or not caring and just going about
your business. It means helping others around you while maintaining san-
ity in your own life.
Being mentally tough comes in all forms. When my grandmother was
on her death bed, everyone came out of the woodwork to visit her. She is
such a staple in our family unit and has brought endless amounts of joy and
love to all her eight children and 27 grandchildren plus great and great-great
grandchildren.
Those farm girls are tough cookies. The hardest part of seeing Grandma on
her deathbed was remembering how she buried her own child 20 years ago,
one of her twins who passed at 40. She also endured the loss of her husband,
my grandfather, 23 years ago. It’s astonishing how many deaths you witness
when you live to 92. Her experiences on the farm have made her mentally
tough. Her only fault is that she worries about everyone else so much because
she cares more than they care about themselves.
IT’S NOT ABOUT ENDURING; IT’S ABOUT
THRIVING AND SUPPORTING THOSE AROUND
YOU, NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
Mental toughness is a learned behavior. I learnt it growing up with my
grandma for much of the year until my early 20s. I mean, we raise animals
just to slaughter and eat them. How much empathy can you have when you
have cattle that you name and raise for two years, only to put them down
118 | STRONG AGAIN
and string them up on a front-end loader? I know exactly where food from
the grocery store comes from. It was a great lesson to learn as a toddler chas-
ing around headless chickens. It is just what we did.
It is just what we did. Oh, the stories that can be told from those words.
I will give one example that I’ve been thinking about all day regarding mil-
itary guys coming back from overseas. I bring this up because I just had my
friend in the gym today talking about how dogs had a specific job in the
Marine Corps: to take one for the team. He said they would go out with 12
dogs and sometimes return with only three. “It is just what we did,” he said.
Once you write down and follow a nutrition guide then get your butt to
the gym, the first two steps in this 12-week journey, it then becomes just what
you do. After the 12-week grind, whether you stuck to the same damn thing
the whole time, or you still got on stage and looked the best you ever had,
you will look back at that time, learn from it, and say, “It is just what I did.”
TRUE STRENGTH LIES IN FACING CHALLENGES
HEAD ON AND HELPING OTHERS, ALL WHILE
MAINTAINING YOUR OWN SANITY
Being mentally tough doesn’t mean staying laser focused and ignoring
everyone else. It means there is always a piece of you thinking about the main
goal. I am not fooling anyone if I say I can do this diet 24/7 off season. But
for 12 weeks, I can.
STRESS MANAGEMENT
Stress is an inevitable part of life, but how we manage it can significantly
impact our overall well-being. My number one strategy over the years is weight
training. But when the shit hits the fan, so to speak, having a diet like this
will bring everything else into sharper focus. This is crucial, because unman-
aged stress can lead to problems with your health and even your marriage.

THE RIGHT STRATEGIES AND SUPPORT
How many people do you know who drink wine or slug back a few brews
every night trying to escape their reality or shitty relationship? Maybe the
relationship is generally good, but some days … you just need a drink. This
can be a stress reducer for sure, as it makes you feel good from time to time.
But fast forward 20 years and you look more like Fat Bastard than the stud
you once were.
My wife and I have our scuff ups here and there. She is a Millennial and
I am the tail end of Gen X, so there’s a generational divide when it comes to
lifestyles and how we grew up. She was a select soccer player on a traveling
team in the summers and I was a select shit scraper on the farm. We came
together through the gym, as we did a show together and hit it off after that.
Through trials and tribulations, things can get rocky. Millennials live via Ins-
tagram and are always comparing. I dive more into work and making more
money because, we all know, money makes everyone happy, right? Well,
maybe for a short time, just like alcohol.
“THE REMEDY FOR MOST MARITAL STRESS IS
NOT IN DIVORCE. IT IS IN REPENTANCE AND
FORGIVENESS, IN SINCERE EXPRESSIONS OF
CHARITY AND SERVICE. IT IS NOT IN SEPARATION. IT
IS IN SIMPLE INTEGRITY THAT LEADS A MAN AND A
WOMAN TO SQUARE UP ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND
MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS.” —GORDON B. HINCKLEY

just the pain—it’s the resentment that festers, the bitterness that seeps into
120 | STRONG AGAIN
every corner of your mind. I reached a point where I didn’t even care what
was going to happen anymore. We had been through the same cycle too many
times before, where our pride got the best of us. The script was always the
same: the fights, the silence, the waiting. Waiting for her to leave. Waiting
for the inevitable. And when the waiting got too heavy, I turned to the bot-
tle or the dip, chasing a fleeting sense of relief. But relief is a liar. It left me
emptier than before, hollowed out and aching.
Our fights would get bad enough where we both thought the only option
was to pack up and leave for good. A night in a hotel here, a solo drive to the
cabin there—anything to escape the suffocating weight of it all. The threats
were endless, but they were empty, just like the silence that followed. Relation-
ships are hard. Damn hard. Or as Dane Cook so eloquently put it, “relation-
shits.” He wasn’t wrong.
In the darkest days of our relationship, the silence stretched on for weeks.
Every word exchanged was sharp, cutting, and laced with disdain. I felt
trapped, cornered by my own thoughts. And then, one day, I thought, I
need a drink. It started with a few beers on a weekend. For a moment, I felt
good—numb, but good. The next night, I found the leftover beers in the
fridge and thought, Why not? This went on for a week and a half, a blur of
bottles and regret. But it wasn’t just me I was hurting. My business started
to suffer. I’d show up hungover, my face swollen from the inflammation, my
mind foggy and unfocused.
I have struggled with the idea of including the last few paragraphs in this
chapter for fear of feeling vulnerable. But vulnerability is where truth lives,
and I’ve barely scratched the surface of the deeper issues and challenges any
relationship faces. We go through life wanting control—craving it, clinging
to it, sometimes at all costs. Even watching my kids play, I can see one trying
to take charge, organizing the game, directing the others. It’s human nature
to want to control the things around us. It makes us feel safe, anchored, as if
holding the reins will keep the chaos of life at bay.
On paper, dieting should be the easiest thing to control. No one is shoving
Week 6 | 121
junk food down our throats; it’s our choice what we put in our bodies. But in
reality, it’s not always that simple. We want to fit in, feel normal, blend into
the rhythms of those around us. When life feels out of control—when rela-
tionships unravel and emotions run riot—we grasp at anything to restore a
sense of order. For me, that led toward habits I thought I’d conquered.
I needed an outlet, a lifeline, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask for help. I
was a prisoner in my own mind, shackled by the need to appear like I had it
all together. The image of perfection was my armor, but it was also my cage.
And the more I tried to hold it together, the more I felt myself falling apart.
In my search for relief, I found myself drifting back to old habits. I used
to chew tobacco back in my college sports days—a casual habit that hung
around for a few years after. By my late 20s, it became a more regular thing,
fueled by coworkers fresh out of college who were “dipping” like it was a rite
of passage. I kept at it through my early 30s, until one of my very first cli-
ents said something that stuck with me. He told me he quit dipping at 35
because, “Why would I still dip after 35? It isn’t good for your mouth and
teeth, and no one wants to look at that crap.” That planted a seed in my mind.
I decided I’d quit at 35 too—and I did.
But when alcohol failed to numb the stress of my unraveling relation-
ship, I thought maybe dipping could fill the void. I was so pissed over our
endless, pointless fights that I went out and bought a tin of Kodiak. After
eight years without it, the first few minutes had me spinning in a way that
almost felt exhilarating—until the nausea hit. For an hour, I felt like throw-
ing up. In the past, I’d have just powered through and kept going, ignoring
how terrible it made me feel. But this time, something shifted. Sitting there,
sick to my stomach, I realized how ridiculous it was. This wasn’t an answer.
It wasn’t worth it.
FROM EMPTY THREATS TO REAL CHANGE:
EMBRACING HEALTHIER COPING MECHANISMS
122 | STRONG AGAIN
I love exercising and achieving my fitness goals, or simply getting into the
gym for a great pump. It’s not about needing to find a gym every day to sur-
vive; it’s about the incredible feeling it gives me. The rush of dopamine and
serotonin makes it all worthwhile, even after a tough workout.
I start my day with exercise because, no matter what happens later, the
hardest part is already done. It’s something I can control. Unlike alcohol or
tobacco, which would control me, exercise empowers me. This realization
hit me hard during a tough time with my wife. We used to argue a lot, each
trying to be right. We both want to control outcomes, and when our ideas
clash due to poor communication, it sparks conflict. But what if we listened
and worked together as a team?
Communication is key, and we’re still working on it. Our different per-
spectives sometimes cause misunderstandings, but that’s no excuse. We both
need to understand each other’s viewpoints.
In my experience we need to be able to control something. If not, we will
feel out of control. Going with the flow is not easy for type A personalities.
Type As need order and structure, and my wife likes to plan. The problem, in
the words of Mike Tyson, is that “everyone has a plan until they get punched
in the mouth.” You need a guide or an idea of what you are doing, and you
need to have the higher executive function to adjust and adapt as your day
unfolds. This comes with experience, and since I am 10 years older than my
wife, I have found that balance of planning but realizing you need to adapt
and adjust on the fly. Microsoft Copilot defined my wife and I perfectly and
why we most likely clash during our “nothing fights” (Microsoft, 2025):
Key characteristics of a type A personality include:
• Competitiveness: Type A individuals often feel the need to win at
everything, whether it’s work-related tasks or personal challenges.
• Achievement-Oriented: They set high goals for themselves and are
driven to succeed, often working long hours to meet their objectives.
Week 6 | 123
• Time Urgency and Impatience: They have a strong sense of urgency
and can become easily frustrated with delays or unproductive time.
• High Stress Levels: Due to their constant drive and high expec-
tations, type A individuals are more prone to stress and related
health issues.
Exercise plays a crucial role in managing stress by offering both physical
and mental benefits. Physically, engaging in regular exercise triggers the release
of endorphins, the body’s natural mood lifters, which help reduce stress and
improve overall mood. Additionally, exercise enhances sleep quality, which is
often disrupted by stress, and boosts energy levels, making it easier to handle
daily stressors. Mentally, exercise provides a healthy distraction from stressors,
allowing you to clear your mind and focus on the present moment. Complet-
ing a workout can also give you a sense of accomplishment, boosting your
confidence and resilience.
TRANSFORM STRESS INTO STRENGTH WITH THE
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFITS OF EXERCISE
By incorporating exercise into your routine, you create a predictable and
empowering habit that provides stability and control, even when other aspects
of life feel chaotic. This sense of control is vital for managing stress, as it rein-
forces the idea that you have the power to positively impact your health and
well-being.
LEVERAGING SUPPORT SYSTEMS
Having a strong social network is crucial when training and maintaining a
bodybuilding diet. Family, friends, and a fitness community provide essen-
tial support that can make a significant difference in your journey. Family
124 | STRONG AGAIN
and friends offer emotional support, encouragement, and understanding,
which can help you stay motivated and committed to your goals. They can
also help create a positive environment by participating in healthy activities
and respecting your dietary choices.
ACHIEVE MORE TOGETHER:
THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF FAMILY, FRIENDS,
AND COMMUNITY IN FITNESS SUCCESS
A fitness community, on the other hand, provides a sense of camaraderie
and accountability. Being surrounded by like-minded individuals who share
similar goals can inspire you to push harder and stay consistent. They can offer
valuable advice, share experiences, and celebrate your achievements, making
the process more enjoyable and less isolating. Together, these support systems
create a robust foundation that helps you navigate challenges, stay focused,
and achieve long-term success in your bodybuilding journey.
When I started lifting, my very first training partner was my older brother,
Don. On the weekends we would sit and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Jean-Claude Van Damme films. Diving into muscle and fitness maga-
zines, we would use weights handed down from our uncle and just pound
away, not really knowing what we were doing but knowing we needed to
grind. Between fingers getting pinched on the narrow fitness bench and
sand leaking out of the dumbbells if you accidentally dropped them, we
were setting and reaching goals at a young age, building up mental as well
as physical strength.
A key moment in my life was learning about another uncle who was a
gymnast. He used to walk across a football field on his hands, and for a week-
end movie night we watched The Barbarian Brothers. I must have been 10 or
11 at the time, and it was an amazing film for a young boy who wanted to be
a superhero. And you need to remember, superhero movies were not around
Week 6 | 125
back then like they are now. In the “action ’80s” superheroes wore tank tops
and were named Mr. T, Hulk Hogan, Dutch, and Lincoln Hawk.
As an incoming freshman trying out for the football team, I was not nearly
as strong as the kids I train now. When I tried to bench press my bodyweight,
135lbs, I barely managed it; in fact, to this day I don’t think I really did. But
I do remember a sophomore nicknamed “Pumpkin” for his large head say-
ing to me, “Jesus dude, you can barely do your bodyweight.” That crushed
me inside, and I knew I had to work harder.
FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS TO POWERFUL LIFTS:
THE EVOLUTION OF A DEDICATED ATHLETE
Hooking up with my best friend and training partner Matt for the next four
years would make us the strongest kids in our high school, and our dreams
of becoming like Dorian Yates and Nasser El Sonbaty were close to coming
true. Well, not quite, but for high school seniors at our first ever state power-
lifting meet, my buddy weighing 165lbs was able to bench press 285lbs. Our
raw weights in the gym were 335lb bench, 450lb squat, and 525lb deadlift.
There was definitely some farm strength mixed with weight training. Most
kids I train now can bench more than 315lbs pretty easily, but they can barely
deadlift 315lbs because their feeble fingers are used more for texting than
work. Kids are more focused on showing off their strength via social media
than actually being strong.
Not knowing what to do with life outside of farming, I went to college
to play football at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire (UWEC). Well,
for a division three school you really need to go for the education, but that
was second fiddle to playing more football. My older cousin Vinnie went to
UWEC, and for most kids from a family like ours where not many go to
college, we just follow what others have done. I was able to get into school
because of football and having decent grades, but not the best.
126 | STRONG AGAIN
At lunch on my first day of football camp, I sat next to a kid I knew that
played in my conference in high school. Walking up to him I said, “Hey, your
name is Rudy, right?” He said, “Actually it is Matt, but Rudy is my nick-
name from the movie.” Not knowing the movie Rudy, I shook my head. Rudy
asked me if I had any nicknames. The only nicknames I ever had growing
up were usually from my dad, and they were “meathead,” “shit for brains,”
“grandpa” … The one that stuck was Buck because I had big ass buck teeth.
From that conversation, a deeper love of bodybuilding emerged and a
new level of pain. Rudy and I pushed each other all the time in the gym dur-
ing our freshman year. Some workouts we would literally train so hard we
couldn’t walk right for days on end. After school in the morning and after-
noon, I would usually check in to see if he wanted to work out or he would
come to my room, and we would both be nerding out on reruns of Lou Fer-
rigno’s The Incredible Hulk. Reading up on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s training
with Franco Columbo, we would do calves to no end, or squat until one of
us puked. He won by puking first after set 17 of 315lbs reps of 10.
FROM SMALL-TOWN GYMS TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL:
BUILDING STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE
In the summer of my freshman year, I trained early with my cousin Vin-
nie, and we would either work out at the high school gym or a small gym
named Lynn and Gina’s in a nearby town called New Lisbon. Lynn was really
inspiring with a wealth of knowledge. It was always awesome going to Lynn’s
gym with my cousin. To this day, I still look up to Vinnie and love catching
up and learning from him. We would often start some workouts with dumb
shit, like, before we warmed up for bench we would do as many sets as it
took to get to 50 pullups. By the end of summer, we were up to 100 pullups,
and that was our pre-warm up for chest day.
Heading back to school, this time more for an education because I switched
Week 6 | 127
majors after almost failing, I needed a new training partner. Rudy left for a
mission trip to Utah and was lost forever. LOL. He actually finished under-
grad and grad school there and is happily married with five kids.
My roommate and I stayed in the dorms for another year. It was nice just
having everything available right on campus. So another football player and
I hooked up as training partners because he was in the same dorm as us and
became a really good friend.
This is when I was a supplement Nazi. I was on everything from cre-
atine, pre workout, ripped fuel (with ephedrine), and androstenedione (Mark
Maguire’s cop out). My buddy Erik and I had great training sessions, but one
story he always tells is that I’d get pissed off because he was always late for
his training sessions. I was such a Nazi about timing out my supplements I
would angrily say, “Dude, I time out my pre-workout so I’m ready to go at 2
pm.” I look back at that and laugh. It comes down to what you are doing in
the weight room that day and not the crappy supplements you put in your
body. Oh yes, I was young and naïve for sure. Erik was a ladies’ man, and he
was always talking to girls after class. His priority, I’m sure, was girls, school,
then weight training.
BUILDING STRENGTH THROUGH
SUPPORT: A LIFELONG JOURNEY OF
PASSION AND PERSEVERANCE
Over the next three years, we always trained together during school, then
it was back to the grind of farm work and training at local home gyms dur-
ing the summer months. I left for the University of Arizona for my internship
and met a couple of great graduate assistants there. This community opened
my eyes to so many more training programs, and not only building strength
but also recovery. This was key for my later career.
My buddy Rudy had just done his first bodybuilding show and looked
128 | STRONG AGAIN
amazing, so I was getting his advice. When you start down a journey like
bodybuilding there are a lot of people out there telling you their approach.
There are also a lot of books that your friends read, but can they put that
knowledge into practice? For example, I was eating a protein-rich diet on
my internship and the graduate assistant there said, “Dude, you need carbs.”
I was baffled because I didn’t want to look like him. I want to look like the
guys in magazines.
Heading into graduate school, I switched mindsets from bodybuilding
to Olympic lifting. We were dealing with stud athletes at North Dakota
State University (NDSU) as they transitioned from Division 2 to Division 1
with Coach Bohl. Throw in new strength coach Jim Kraemer and my train-
ing knowledge really took off. My Olympic lifts also excelled as I was able to
clean 350lbs, vertical jump 36” and still be athletic; but I always wanted to
get on the bodybuilding stage.
Once I learned Ronnie Coleman was going to be the guest poser at the
NPC Upper Midwest Championships, I knew I had to do it. Rudy already
had a show under his belt, and my cousin Vinnie just won a contest by show-
ing before and after pictures following the Max OT program put on by AST
Sports Science. I learnt from these guys, then started shitting my pants with
nerves because I was finally going to do it. My main training partner was
Keyonte Jackson, one of the athletes at NDSU from Milwaukee. Training
with him on Sunday mornings was fulfilling for us as we both had the same
goal in mind: making ourselves better. He wanted to do the show and could
have, but I think the nerves got to him. Still, he was there for support.
FULL CIRCLE: THE JOURNEY FROM A YOUNG
DREAMER TO A SEASONED BODYBUILDER
Having that support system is what my journey has all been about. It
took me from being a young boy with dreams to fulfilling those dreams and
Week 6 | 129
meeting Big Ron backstage. As I write this book, it has been 20 years since
that day, and the conclusion of this book has Ronnie Coleman at a show in
Milwaukee called the Badger State. This has been full circle for me, and who
knows what will come next.
IT ALL STARTS WITH FAMILY
The first step in building a supportive network is to tell your spouse and fam-
ily about your fitness and dietary goals. Explain why these goals are impor-
tant to you and how their support can make a significant difference. By
sharing your aspirations and the reasons behind them, you help your loved
ones understand your commitment and the positive impact it can have on
your overall well-being. This open communication fosters a sense of involve-
ment and encourages them to support you in your journey. Since I am that
type A personality, I usually just do what I want as long as it doesn’t interfere
with my family. So, for example, I already wake up super early so that works,
but eating clean is all on me. No one forces me to eat clean, it is my choice.
Involve your family in your healthy activities, such as cooking nutritious
meals or working out together. This not only creates a supportive environ-
ment but also makes your fitness journey more enjoyable and inclusive. When
your family is involved, they are more likely to understand and respect your
dietary choices and workout schedules. Additionally, these shared activities
can strengthen family bonds and promote a healthier lifestyle for everyone.
Working quite a bit during the week to make ends meet, I grab opportuni-
ties when I can to take my kids on walks or have them ride their bikes while
I walk the dog. Get out and be active with them.
Setting boundaries and expectations will help you reach your goals. Clearly
communicate your needs, such as specific mealtimes or workout schedules,
and ask for your family’s understanding and cooperation. Setting boundar-
ies and expectations helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that your
fitness goals are respected. For example, you might need uninterrupted time
for your workouts or specific foods to be available at home. By discussing
130 | STRONG AGAIN
these needs openly, you can create a harmonious environment where your
fitness goals can thrive without causing friction.
STRONGER TOGETHER: THE POWER OF FAMILY
INVOLVEMENT IN YOUR FITNESS SUCCESS
Share your progress and celebrate milestones with your family. Their
encouragement and recognition can boost your motivation and strengthen
your bond. Celebrating together not only acknowledges your hard work but
also reinforces the importance of their support. Whether it’s a small achieve-
ment like sticking to your diet for a month or a significant milestone like
reaching a new personal best in your workouts, involving your family in these
celebrations makes them feel like an integral part of your journey.
EXPANDING TO A BROADER COMMUNITY
Join local gyms or fitness classes where you can meet like-minded individuals.
Group classes, in particular, can foster a sense of camaraderie and account-
ability. Being part of a group with similar goals can inspire you to push harder
and stay consistent. This will help you drag your butt to the gym and just
get something done, even if you don’t want to. It will also get your mind off
food if you are addicted to it.
Engage with fitness professionals and those that have achieved what you
are looking to do. Build relationships with trainers, nutritionists, or coaches
that have done shows. See how they looked at the shows. Anyone can say they
are a bodybuilder, but are they? Their expertise and guidance can be invalu-
able, and they often have connections to broader fitness communities. Pro-
fessional support can help you refine your approach and achieve your goals
more effectively.
The focus of this chapter, like every week in this book, is to stay the course.
When we veer off course, it’s crucial to correct the ship as soon as possible and
Week 6 | 131
maintain that correction for the duration of these 12 weeks. We are all pro-
grammed through successes and failures. Keep doing the mundane and focus-
ing on the end goal, and the look will come! Don’t be swayed by social media.
Find training partners with similar goals. The first goal will be to get some
numbers for your main lifts like bench press, squat, deadlift, or for your body-
weight lifts like pullups and pushups. Now, improve each week! The real secret
to success is consistency and learning from reliable sources, not quick fixes.
Action Steps
• Take photos and stay consistent
• Try something new: join, engage, and succeed
• Build a community or join a community
• Have a sit down with your support group and really look at your
goals and where you are going

MEET THE CREEPER: DOUBT
(NOT THE OLD GUY IN THE GYM)
You are a little more than halfway now. This is a precarious position to
be in because your initial optimism and enthusiasm might be fading
but the finish line is still a way off. Twelve weeks was the goal. A mere
three months to transform, to sculpt, to learn how to eat, to emerge anew
like a phoenix being reborn. As the daily calendar pages of The Far Side com-
ics flutter by, your mind is being tested by the relentless march of time. At
the start it seemed doable, but at this point you’re tempted to flip the script.
STAY THE COURSE
Doubt is that despicable companion, always chatting in my ear. Like a
creeping shadow, its whispers grow louder and more appealing until it is ring-
ing in my ears, an undercurrent in my thoughts, a ghostly echo in my sleep.
Doubt is hard to escape from; it clings to my skin and can seep into my bones,
settling over me like a fog over a slow-moving stream. Brushing my teeth in
the mornings with my shirt off, it stares back at me through the mirror, tell-
ing me to quit. When I bend over to put on my socks with tight hamstrings
and a tight lower back each morning, doubt will remind me that my belly is
still folding over my underwear.
Doubt is that phantom weight we carry each and every day. Even as we
136 | STRONG AGAIN
step on the scales to validate that we are doing the right thing, it is there to
taunt us when the needle hasn’t moved one notch, or has even gone up.
DOUBT: THE UNSEEN WEIGHT
THAT SHADOWS EVERY STEP
Doubt is sitting beside me riding shotgun as I drive to the work or gym,
tapping its fingers on the dashboard and crossing its arms like my wife does
when I miss an exit. “Are you sure?” “Why didn’t you get off here?” “Why are
we off course?” The journey seems short and clear at first, and then as each
mile goes by it stretches longer and longer. It’s easy to look in the rearview
mirror and realize all the missteps I have taken, or the progress I haven’t made.
Rarely do I look back and say, “Wow, I am certain I am going the right way.”
Daily conversations with clients or friends become tightropes. I listen
to discussions on weekend indulgences, their laughter punctuating tales of
Packer parties and wine dinners. Instead of fantasy football numbers I am
calculating macros, calories, steps taken, and steps missed. I nod, smile, but
behind my eyes doubt paces like a caged animal. We call it willpower or dis-
cipline, but it feels like wrestling an invisible opponent, and each round
leaves me breathless.
It is interesting that the weight we are trying to shed is being put on our
shoulders. We carry it like a millstone of worry around our necks. As a per-
sonal trainer and a gym owner, the expectations are even higher, because this
is what I do. There are no shortcuts, no secret doors to slip through. Success
isn’t a secret affair; it requires sweat, discipline, and a stubborn refusal to yield.
My alarm doesn’t care if I am tired. It sits and waits each night to begin another
successful day while the snooze button patiently whispers, “Maybe tomorrow.”
And so, I lumber on like a tractor pulling a full load of hay down the high-
way. Everyone passes me by with their weekend plans of parties and fatty foods,
while I trudge on down the road. There is no easy way out, no short cuts or
Week 7 | 137
secret potions. Only the slow, intentional crawl toward the finish line. Suc-
cess is not a sprint; it’s a marathon. While most people quit a diet after two
weeks, I am still sowing my fields and getting ready to harvest.
That chain around your neck is doubt, and how heavy you make it is up to
you. Doubt is a companion, not a foe. It walks beside us hand in hand, urg-
ing us to prove it wrong. Everything we do in life is encompassed by doubt:
first day of school, first job interview, first relationship, or first-time parent-
ing. These are all moments that are challenging, but they also offer opportu-
nities for growth and learning.
EMBRACE THE JOURNEY:
TURN DOUBT INTO DETERMINATION
Taking each day one step at a time is a cliché we need to stick to during
this phase. It’s a bit like growing your hair long. For men trying to get that
perfect man bun or herculean look, the middle of the road can look awful.
For women, getting that popular half-head shave will look awful growing
back out. But persistence is key. We need to keep pushing through to get the
results we want, otherwise we will slip back and just do a combover on the
bald spot of failed attempts.
KNOW YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING
We all have our doubts; we all have dark corners in our minds. But know
this: Tomorrow is a new day. Do not hit that snooze button of uncertainty;
instead, keep moving forward. Harness doubt as the driving force it is meant
to be, and let it fuel your determination to prove it wrong.
I like to draw strength from my roots, from where I’m from, and nothing
symbolizes this better for me that my state’s flag. Being from Wisconsin the
138 | STRONG AGAIN
flag is a part of you, of your heritage, and it has a deep meaning and value.
Embracing this helps me to walk through life.
FORGE YOUR PATH: GO FORTH WITH
STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE
We are known as the “Badger State” in Wisconsin, but you might also
recognize us as the “Cheese State.” The miner and the sailor on our state
flag symbolize our rich natural resources and strategic position on the Great
Lakes. The shield is divided into four sections: the plow, representing agri-
culture; the pick and shovel, symbolizing mining; the arm and hammer,
denoting manufacturing; and the anchor, representing navigation. Above
the badger, our state motto, “Forward,” reflects Wisconsin’s relentless drive
for progress.
This state, my state, embodies everything about this 12-week diet. We
are consuming natural foods from the earth as our protein source and uti-
lizing minerals and vitamins derived from our God-given planet. We know
the direction we are headed; though the seas can be choppy at times and the
journey long, the destination is straight ahead. Our bodies are like blocks
of raw iron that need to be manufactured and molded into a steel cast that
remains unbreakable even in the most turbulent waters. We do this through
hard work, diet, and discipline. Having a forward-thinking mindset is essen-
tial, helping us achieve incremental progress through tough times. Building
a strong body involves cultivating a strong mind. The “Forward” motto sup-
ports mental resilience, helping us stay committed to our journey.
ADAPTABILITY: THE ART OF FLEXIBILITY
Motivation can wane at this halfway mark. Life throws us curveballs, and sud-
denly six weeks have just passed us by. Crazy how long away it seemed at the
start and yet all of a sudden, oh shit, we only have a few weeks left.
Week 7 | 139
How has your diet been going so far? Do you focus on protein, vegeta-
bles, and fruit at parties or a get-together? If it’s football season, maybe a lot
of people you know are having drinking parties. And if you are not a football
fan, what “season” is it for you? We all have “seasons” we go through where
our interests, work, college, family, and friends throw us curveballs, but we
cannot use them as an excuse.
ADAPT, LEARN, AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD
Being adaptable isn’t failing, it is being resilient. If you can have this mind-
set, you are more likely to stay the course. So you messed up on a Saturday
night, big deal, get back on. Don’t act like my three-year-old after his toy train
set comes apart and throw a fit. Like I tell him, “Hey, it is okay, because now
we can build it stronger or better.” Use those moments to learn about your-
self instead of throwing it away.
FORWARD!
Moving forward is our motto, and learning is the way to do it. Next time
you are at a party and break down, figure out why. Did you tell yourself, Every-
one was drinking? Or how about, It was just one bite!
You learn when you realize what you did and say to yourself, Hey, when
I go to another party next weekend, I should eat before I go so I can indulge in a
slice of pizza or a glass of wine but have the control to not go overboard. When
you start having that mentality, you may not even want that piece of pizza or
wine because your goals are more important than that.
Life happens, and making small adjustments like this doesn’t mean you’ve
lost the race. Oftentimes, we think these pro bodybuilders do everything right
and never cheat. But here is the key: They cheat with healthy foods that will
140 | STRONG AGAIN
not affect them; foods not part of their normal diet that are so delicious that
they look forward to it.
I found this out years ago when I saw a post by Flex Lewis, a prominent
bodybuilder posting about his one-day-a-week cheat meal, which was sushi
rolls. I love sushi rolls, and I tried it out. Now it is a part of my Thursday carb
load day. I crave it on Thursday, and it is a great date night out if you want
it to be. The other cheat days can be baked fish and a side of steamed vegeta-
bles. You can even throw a plain baked potato in there. Staying on a healthy
clean diet like we have been, putting a little salt on that baked potato makes
it taste like French fries.
The goal of this diet isn’t to become robots. If you have zero self-control,
you may want to stay as strict as you can; that is how most of us start. But by
learning about “clean” foods and a protein-first diet, you will get the results
you have longed for.
SEEING THE FOREST AND THE TREES:
VISUAL PROGRESS
Visual progress is the only progress we can take in right now. Get off the
scales unless you know for sure you haven’t put on weight. During my lifts
this week, I did a “jump jiggle test.” This is where you flex in a mirror every
muscle in your body, then hop up and down to see what jiggles. Women,
you may want to hold your breasts and just focus on a side profile to see the
thighs and butt, where you most likely carry most of your weight. Guys, you
may want to hold your breasts too if you are fatty, but we want that six pack,
so let’s put our focus on that. I call my belly button a donut because when I
start losing fat and seeing the abs, the belly has a fat pocket that looks like a
donut, a protrusion around the sides of the button that jiggle during the test.
TRUST THE MIRROR, NOT THE SCALES:
VISUAL PROGRESS IS KEY
Week 7 | 141
I did my jump jiggle test yesterday morning, and I was happy with the
progress. Then for shits and giggles, I hopped on the scales; up another three
pounds. Holy buckets … I started this diet at 218lbs and I weighed in at
228lbs. I am looking better in the mirror, but my weight is going up. Holy
mental mind f&ck!
This is why you cannot trust the scales; instead, you need to see the prog-
ress with your eyes. No one cares that you lost the same five pounds doing
the same stupid diet you have been doing your whole life. That is pathetic.
Grow some balls and take some damn pictures. The weight is going to start
coming off after this micro cycle. But right now, we are still manufacturing
and transforming our iron ore to be sculpted in the next couple weeks.
GET OFF THE SCALES: “UNLEARN WHAT
YOU HAVE LEARNED”— YODA
My wife competed in a pro physique show with the help of Shelby Starnes,
a fitness/diet coach. Each week she had to send photos of herself in her suit
to him. He would adjust her nutritional needs based on those pictures. If
you are still fat, time to adjust.
This is where the doubt creeps in. What is the easiest thing we think of
when we need to lose weight? Cut calories. This is the worst thing to do. And
the dumbest. Talk about messing up your metabolism. Stick with the nutri-
tion guide and master plan you created, stay within those calories, and keep
trudging along. Make doubt your ally and prove all these bastards wrong. The
bastards in this case are your own thoughts saying you can’t do it. F&ck them.
THE POWER OF RITUALS AND HABITS
Midway doubts often stem from wavering habits. Don’t look in the rear-
view mirror, and keep moving forward. Each step forward is like a tick on
the road—brief, passing, and uniform. These moments may feel small, but
142 | STRONG AGAIN
together they build progress. Focus on the journey ahead and your daily hab-
its, so if a misstep occurs, you can quickly get back on track.
Alarm rings, time to wake up. Don’t hit snooze, as that is procrastination
waiting for you to fail. Eat the same thing you had yesterday for breakfast,
and the day before, the weeks before. Pack your snacks and your lunches, you
already know what you are having and how your day plays out. If something
comes up that may throw you off, that is okay, because you have a back-up
plan; you have always had one. Dinner tonight, no big deal, it is the same
healthy thing you ate last night but instead of chicken you are having turkey,
steak, or a veggie burger (but extra protein shake). You know what is hap-
pening day in and day out. You can control these things. Plan to succeed, do
not fail to plan.
STAY THE COURSE:
CONSISTENCY AND PLANNING
LEAD TO SUCCESS
When are you most likely to lose control? Savor the food. If you want
that apple, eat it with a knife and skin it piece by piece. Enjoy the moments,
enjoy the taste. Be thankful you can eat whole foods right from the ground
that you carefully prepared. Yes, ordering out is easy, but don’t be lazy. Instead,
take pride in the hard work you are doing. Most people will never realize
what you are putting yourself through: the discipline, the thoughts. Remem-
ber, the end is near. You will emerge like a grizzly bear from hibernation and
everyone in your kingdom will have to stop and look in astonishment at your
majestic beauty.
SUCCESS TAKES TIME
Week 7 | 143
Build your community of support. Be someone’s accountability partner.
At this point, people are looking to you for advice. Take them along on the
journey and encourage each other. Cook with friends. Have play dates with
other families and encourage healthy food options, no alcohol, and fun with
the kids.
Our pastime in Wisconsin is drinking at bars or drinking at home. It is
amazing how much alcohol is consumed here. My wife and I are often the
only ones at parties not drinking. I always respected my dad when he said he
would never drink in front of us kids. As we lose that generation, from my
perspective, family birthday parties or any regular gathering it seems like this
generation, the tail end of Gen X, just wants to drink. Just remember, you
don’t want to be needing AA by the time you reach AARP age.
DON’T WHINE WHEN YOU MISS OUT ON ACHIEVING
YOUR GOALS AND LIVING A FULFILLING LIFE
This isn’t about telling you not to drink. We all have our vices, and I under-
stand that. What really matters to me is setting and achieving goals. It’s about
figuring out what you want to accomplish and staying focused on that path.
Whether it’s related to health, fitness, or personal growth, the key is to have
clear goals and work towards them consistently. Slips and vices are part of
life, but they shouldn’t derail your journey. Remember why you started, keep
your eyes on the prize, and celebrate your progress.
Alcohol will not help you reach any goals, just an earlier grave. But focus
on the quality of your life in hitting those goals, not just how long you will
live for. What’s the point of being miserable until you are 100 and needing a
drink to quieten the doubts and fears caused by years of not striving for any-
thing. Yes, you may lose a couple years if you drink, but it isn’t as bad as los-
ing faith in family and friends and your ability to not follow through.

IMPORTANCE OF RECOVERY
Recovery is a crucial component of any successful diet regimen. It is
during recovery that muscles repair, grow, and strengthen, making it
just as important as the workouts themselves. Proper nutrition plays
a vital role in this process. Consuming the right balance of protein and car-
bohydrates before and after workouts can significantly enhance muscle repair
and growth. Nutrient timing is key, as it ensures that your body has the nec-
essary fuel to recover effectively.
Additionally, optimizing sleep quality is essential, as deep, restful sleep
allows the body to heal and rejuvenate. Incorporating active recovery tech-
niques like light cardio, stretching, and foam rolling can further aid in reducing
muscle soreness and preventing injuries. By understanding and implement-
ing effective recovery strategies, including a well-balanced diet, you can max-
imize your gains and maintain long-term health and performance.
“BRO, COME HELP ME GET OFF THE SHITTER”
Having an effective workout does not mean you can’t get off the toilet the
next morning. While muscle soreness can be a sign of a challenging workout,
it shouldn’t be the sole indicator of effectiveness. In fact, constantly pushing
yourself to the point of extreme soreness can lead to overtraining, increased risk
of injury, and burnout. But I will warn you, the first time doing new exercises
148 | STRONG AGAIN
in a progressive overload manner, you will be sore. Taking time away from
the gym, even after one or two weeks, feels like you are starting all over again.
Starting off easy and gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts
is a smarter approach. This method, known as progression, allows your body
to adapt to new stressors in a controlled manner. By progressively increasing
the weight, reps, or duration of your exercises, you can steadily build strength
and endurance without overwhelming your muscles and joints.
Having a three- to four-week plan for working out is better than chang-
ing your workouts each week. You can chart your progress. Just think how
your stomach reacts every time you change your foods. I want you to try this
experiment: 1) Follow your food plan for one week; 2) pick one day to change
your protein sources to fatty beef sticks and deli meats. I guarantee you will
be shitting through a screen door. Your body can adapt fast after a few simi-
lar days, but constantly changing it up will make you fatter and weaker when
it comes to nutrition and exercise.
PROGRESSION KEEPS THOSE MUSCLES GUESSING
Progression also helps in maintaining consistency, which is key to long-
term success in bodybuilding. It ensures that you are continually challenging
your body, but in a way that promotes recovery and growth. This balanced
approach not only enhances performance but also reduces the likelihood of
setbacks due to injury or fatigue. Remember, the goal is sustainable progress,
not just short-term gains.
EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS
ALLEVIATE SORE MUSCLES
Foam rolling, or self-myofascial release, helps to break up muscle knots and
improve blood flow to the affected areas. This can reduce muscle tightness
and soreness, promoting faster recovery.
Week 8 | 149
I didn’t learn about foam rolling until after my undergrad. At 23 years
old I thought foam rolling was amazing. It hurt so good. It is a great way to
warm up the muscles before lifts and to flush them out after your exercise. I
envision my muscles like a million tiny cables lying next to each other. They
all contract and shorten just a tiny bit, but together this adds up to a huge
length. These are called your Z lines.
Imagine a knot forming when cables get tangled. You can stretch them
out somewhat, but to fully straighten them, you need to lay them back in a
straight line. As a father of two daughters, I’ve learned that conditioner is great
for detangling their hair. Without it, brushing dry, greasy hair is a nightmare.
Well, a foam roller is like conditioner for your muscles. It breaks up tissue
and aligns fibers for a proper stretch. Without it, stretching is like brushing
through a tangled mess, with your shoulder or knee joint screaming in protest.
Regular massages, dry needling, and even acupuncture with stim can help
to relax muscles, reduce tension, and improve circulation. This not only allevi-
ates soreness but also enhances overall muscle function and flexibility. I hadn’t
used this much previously until I really needed to. Injuries lifting weights and
sleepless nights were driving factors. Using these techniques got me interested
in self-trigger point massage and using more Thera Canes, lacrosse balls, and
other roll-out methods with bars and pipes.
TRANSFORM PAIN INTO PROGRESS
One of my favorite massage techniques is called Gua Sha, or the Graston
technique. One morning after sparring practice in Muay Thai, I could barely
walk. My coworkers saw me hobble into work and said, “What the hell hap-
pened to you?” I explained that it was my first real sparring session with one
of our guys, and I took four leg kicks right above the knee. If you have never
been kicked there, I will tell you it doesn’t feel good if you are not conditioned.
The first one or two kicks you feel like Jean-Claude Van Damme in Bloodsport
150 | STRONG AGAIN
trading kicks back and forth, then the third and fourth one come and you can
no longer walk. That is Muay Thai for you: If you can’t walk, you can’t fight.
We practiced some Gua Sha on each other, then our certified therapist for
that day massaged me. Remember, I came in there limping and hobbling. After
about 10 minutes of scraping and getting the inflammation out of the area
and making the skin about four shades of color from pink to purple, my knee
felt brand new. The whole process did not feel good at all, but man it worked.
It reminds me of a documentary where a bodybuilder blew out his pecto-
ral muscle. The athletic trainer used her bodyweight and elbow to dig into the
pec with all her might, causing the guy to squirm in discomfort. He recovered
quickly because the therapist improved blood flow to his injury, delivering
healing nutrients instead of them being trapped in tangled tissue. This also
brings to mind an interview with a professional athlete who said training so
hard may cause an injury, but when you do get hurt, you need to focus and
work even harder to overcome the injury and get back to training.
INJURY? NO STOPPING, JUST SMARTER TRAINING
I take that to mean that if you are injured, there is no stopping; you need
to keep working. If you sprain your ankle: traction, ankle mobility, Gua Sha.
After a week you need to continually do what is called flossing for neural pat-
terns. All this stuff is second nature to seasoned lifters and strength coaches,
but the bottom line is you can’t quit. I do not pretend to know everything,
and I’m not trying to impress you with big words or blah blah blah. The big-
gest takeaway is simple: Just don’t quit! Too many times I see people who
have a boo-hoo and call it a day. Is that you? I had an older client who rolled
her ankle doing some lateral high knee steps between two hurdles. Pretty
rudimentary stuff. For at least three years after that if I ever ran into her, she
would say, “Remember when you injured me?” I wanted to say, “Oh, are
you still hung over from the night before like you were then?” Don’t be the
Week 8 | 151
sad sack who lets one incident from the past define them. Look in the mir-
ror and live in the now.
Engaging in low-intensity activities such as walking, swimming, or yoga
can help to increase blood flow and reduce muscle stiffness. Active recovery
helps to flush out metabolic waste products from the muscles, speeding up
the recovery process. There is a caveat to this one. During the pandemic, I
made myself do yoga twice a week. I would still lift four days a week, do mar-
tial arts two days a week, and then on my off days I would do yoga. I have
never had looser or better feeling hamstrings, but my back was always tight. I
could never figure it out. My gauge was waking up in the morning and bend-
ing over to put my socks on.
I used to put my foot at the end of the bed until my wife snapped at me
one morning. So, I moved to the bathroom. She hasn’t kicked me out yet,
but pretty soon I’ll be in the garage putting my clothes on. Anyway, when I
bent over, I would have to hold my breath and hurry to put a sock on, come
back up for air, then quickly bend over to put the other one on. I wondered
what the heck was going on?
Through trial and error and a lot of trigger point massage with broomsticks,
Thera Canes, and foam rollers, I finally figured it out. It wasn’t my hips or lower
back that I was focusing on. It was my lats, specifically near my kidneys. If you
lie in a side plank position with the foam roller under your side, then tilt a little
backwards, you will find the culprit. It hurts like a bitch. It would be so painful
I couldn’t roll on it; I would just have to sit for a minute and use the roller like a
trigger point massage tool. After switching a couple times from each side, I was
able to finally roll on it without a crazy amount of pain. My lower back pain
went away almost immediately. I have recently upgraded to a longer Graston
tool which I use to scrape my lats by myself. It reminds me of “the stick” I used
to use, but this is a scraping tool that lays those fibers down like they should be.
SETBACKS ARE SETUPS FOR COMEBACKS
152 | STRONG AGAIN
SLEEP
Getting plenty of sleep is crucial for overall health, especially for those engaged
in strenuous exercise. Sleep is when your body repairs muscle tissues, con-
solidates memories, and restores energy. Without adequate sleep, you risk
fatigue and decreased performance. Although I’m not a sleep expert, I always
thought six hours was enough.
I often fall asleep sitting up. I used to think I had narcolepsy, but I
recently discovered I get good sleep, just not enough of it. A friend from
Tae Kwon Do, Dr. Gregory A. Burek, MD—a psychiatrist and Marine Corps
veteran—helped me realize this.
At a martial arts gathering, I mentioned to Greg that I get up at 3 am to
work out, and he said, “I can treat that.” I didn’t understand at first, but con-
tinued explaining my training regimen. After a while, I asked Greg what he
did for a living. He explained that he works with veterans and first respond-
ers with PTSD, and that sleep is a major issue for many of them. He also
explained why I get so tired sitting at stop lights or sitting on my chair at night.
Interestingly, he said a lot of people get fat because of their poor sleep
rather than diet. Sleeping like crap increases cortisol because of the stress
caused by staying awake all the time. Cortisol causes cravings for carbohy-
drate-rich foods and sugars. It sounds like we need to get to the core of the
issue with fatness.
PRIORITIZE SLEEP FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE
He explained two of my clients perfectly without knowing them. I have a
group of three guys in their mid-30s that deal with stress all the time, one of
whom is a firefighter. He averages 30 minutes of deep sleep each night and
wakes up repeatedly. The other client, who is the gal that lost 80lbs I men-
tioned earlier, is scared to go to bed at night because when she was young,
her dad would often come home drunk. Later, after her child had a seizure,
Week 8 | 153
she couldn’t go to sleep fearing her daughter wouldn’t wake up. Those habits
became normal for her, and she is usually a mess trying to fall asleep.
Let’s break down some of the wisdom Greg shared using Microsoft Copi-
lot (Microsoft, 2025):
1. Sleep and Cortisol:
• Greg hit the nail on the head: poor sleep quality can indeed wreak
havoc on our cortisol levels. Cortisol, often called the “stress
hormone,” plays a crucial role in our body’s response to stress.
• When we don’t get enough restorative sleep, cortisol production
can go haywire. It’s like our internal stress alarm system is stuck
on snooze, and that can lead to all sorts of issues—including
those late-night cravings for carbs and sugars.
2. The Core of Fatness:
• Addressing fatness isn’t just about diet and exercise; it’s about
understanding the underlying factors. Sleep, stress, and emo-
tional well-being are all part of that core.
• Sometimes, it’s not just about burning calories; it’s about heal-
ing our minds and bodies.
3. Your Clients’ Stories:
• Your firefighter clients—those sleep-deprived warriors—remind
us that stress takes a toll. Their bodies are like engines running
on fumes, and it’s no wonder they’re struggling.
• And your gal who lost 80 pounds—her past experiences have
etched fear into her nighttime routine. It’s incredible how our
history shapes our present.
154 | STRONG AGAIN
Whether it is the trauma of a drunk father, the experience of war, road-
side crashes, or the anxiety of a child’s health, those imprints linger in life.
Here is the beautiful part: Healing is possible. As a few of my clients have
shown, you can rewrite those narratives, one night of restful sleep and one
mindful breath at a time.
SLEEP FOR RECOVERY
When you don’t get enough sleep, your muscles don’t have the opportu-
nity to fully recover from your workouts. This can result in prolonged sore-
ness, reduced strength, and a higher risk of injury. Additionally, lack of sleep
can negatively impact your hormone levels, including those responsible for
muscle growth and recovery, such as testosterone and growth hormone. Your
growth hormone is produced when you sleep at night. I average five hours
and 45 minutes of sleep each night. Of that, looking at stats on my Garmin
watch over the last month, my average deep sleep is roughly an hour and 45
minutes each night and my light sleep is around three and a half hours. The
rest, about 15-30 minutes each night, is REM sleep. I barely wake up during
that sleep, so it is nearly a solid six hours.
A client of mine always argued with me about sleep. She would say, “You
don’t get enough sleep,” but just minutes earlier, she mentioned how she slept
poorly over eight to 10 hours. I guarantee that if we compared our sleep cycles,
mine would be better than most. Factors like alcohol, food, stress, and exer-
cise all influence how well you sleep each night.
Being tired throughout the day not only affects your physical perfor-
mance but also your mental focus and motivation. It becomes harder to stay
consistent with your workouts and maintain a positive mindset. Over time,
this can lead to burnout and hinder your progress. Talking with my friend
Greg, I found out why we become so tired throughout the day. Well, in my
case at least. I wake up so early for my workout that I put my body under a
Week 8 | 155
lot of stress. Good stress. But regardless, this causes adenosine to build up
in the frontal lobe of my brain. With heightened adrenaline you get height-
ened adenosine trying to calm you down. According to Greg, sleep is when
you get rid of all the adenosine in your forebrain so you can have a fully func-
tioning, non-sleepy day. Maybe that is why I can’t read books that often or I
am falling asleep at the computer as I type this ……………………... kid-
ding! (Not kidding!)
SLEEP DEPRIVATION
Growing up and helping on a small dairy farm, I was never a stranger to hard
work. At 19 years old I was helping my uncle once again during the sum-
mer. But this time I was also working at a go-kart track in Wisconsin’s tour-
ist capital, Wisconsin Dells. My uncle and aunt took a vacation for five days.
If I didn’t drive to the Dells for work, I drove there to meet up with my girl-
friend. Mornings starting at 4 am come pretty fast when you get home at 2
or 3 am. I remember making stupid comments like, “If it wasn’t for driving,
I wouldn’t get any sleep at all.” The week that my uncle and aunt were gone,
I got 13 hours of sleep in five days. It was like a badge of honor to bust my
butt all day and feel like I could do it forever. I remember listening to stories
from my grandfather who would work with concrete all day, drive five hours
to our cottage in Wabeno, WI, to fish first thing in the morning all day and
then head back. I wanted to be badass like my grandpa.
WHEN SLEEP BECOMES A LIFELINE
The weeks caught up with me. Most road accidents happen a mile from
your house, I am told. That night was the same as any other night. Coming
back from the Wisconsin Dells trying to stay awake and ending up in the
opposite lanes of the highway was wearing on me. I specifically remember set-
ting my can of soda down as I got on the highway before I started dozing off.
156 | STRONG AGAIN
I no longer had that caffeine rush in me, and my adenosine was telling me
it was time to go to bed. I don’t remember what day it was but it was about
two weeks before fall football camp started.
I remember everything about the accident. The sudden jolt of my car
and screaming out in pain. I remember Wanda, a volunteer first responder
who arrived quickly to the scene, gave me a blanket through the passenger
side window that had been smashed from the impact. I remember hear-
ing a voice asking if the cans were beer cans. All I could reply was, “I just
want to go to sleep.” I heard the sound of a hydraulic ram, similar to one
we had at the farm, but this time it was coming from a firetruck. My car’s
roof crunched and twisted as the first responders cut it away, driving my
knee further into the dashboard it seemed, and my foot was dislocated and
underneath my seat. I basically had my left leg in the fetal position with
my left ear to my knee.
THE CRASH SHATTERED GLASS, BONES, AND
ILLUSIONS. WANDA’S VOICE, THE FIRETRUCKS
HYDRAULIC RAM—IT ALL BLURRED
My grandfather took a picture of my car with backless, blood-stained
seats. I was told the seats had to be cut out so they could lift me out of the
top and back side of the car. The reason they found me was my right head-
light flew out of the car and hit a house 100 feet away. My aunt swears she
heard moaning and screaming in the middle of that night. I was less than a
mile away from home, and in the flatlands of Adams County where sound
carries as if it is over a lake on a still night, that is understandable.
It wasn’t the joy a helicopter ride should be as I was flown to hospital. I
kicked at the nurse as a reflex when she grabbed my broken ankle trying to
pull me into the chopper. The next thing I remember was waking up in a
brightly-lit hallway as I was carted to a hospital room and feeling like I was
Week 8 | 157
getting good sleep. But this time, my parents and oldest sister were there.
“What are you guys doing here?” I asked. I literally thought it was time to
get up to milk cows.
POPCORN, DIET SODA, AND SLEEP SURVIVAL
I still run on little sleep but take care during drives to bring snacks that I
can munch on. Popcorn is a huge help, and my vice is diet soda. I will drink
diet soda and eat popcorn on long drives to stay awake if I am feeling tired,
because they have not determined my outcome on the bodybuilding stage.
But they have saved me from being so tired while driving. I pray to never go
through that again.
SLEEP CONSISTENTLY IF YOU CAN
Incorporating good sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consis-
tent sleep schedule, creating a restful environment, and avoiding stimu-
lants before bedtime, can significantly enhance your recovery and overall
well-being. My sleep schedule is like my eating schedule. I try to go to bed
around the same time each night and wake at the same time each morn-
ing. Knowing what I recently learned from Greg, I want to try to get more
sleep to at least help clear the adenosine in my brain. My average deep sleep
seems to be really good, especially compared to everyone else I have been
asking at my gym.
Staying consistent with sleep is just as important as staying consistent with
dieting. Next time you go out partying or if you are wondering why you are
fat and bloated, think about your schedule and your food choices. Think
about the saying “Freshman 15” and how you are literally eating like you are
in college. It is time to grow up before you put on the “30 by 30.” Prioritiz-
ing sleep ensures that you are fully recharged and ready to tackle your next
workout with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
158 | STRONG AGAIN
ACTIVE RECOVERY
Active recovery is a powerful tool in any fitness regimen, especially for intense
exercise or sore muscles. The idea is simple: Doing something is always better
than doing nothing. Engaging in low-intensity activities like walking, swim-
ming, or yoga can help increase blood flow, reduce muscle stiffness, and pro-
mote faster recovery. One word of advice I always give my clients is do the
same exercises that made you sore as soon as you can.
You all know what “lunge butt” feels like, right? Well, when your butt is
so sore you can barely get off the toilet, it is best to foam roll and stretch a bit;
but, honestly, doing lunges again but with fewer reps and less bodyweight will
get you feeling way better. When it comes to calves, if you destroyed them
then good luck. I always say it will take a week for those bad boys to recover.
My old lifting buddy Rudy and I did that back in college. We couldn’t walk
normally for four days and our calves were still tender three days later.
ACTIVE RECOVERY: YOUR SECRET SAUCE
FOR SORENESS AND SANITY
One of the most effective active recovery techniques is foam rolling or
using a lacrosse ball. These methods help to break up muscle knots, improve
circulation, and release tension. Not only do they aid in physical recovery, but
they also have a positive impact on your mental state. Rolling out can clear
your mood and head, providing a sense of relaxation and well-being. This past
year, with a few new clients in their mid-40s to early 50s, we started an “old
man roll-out day.” On Wednesdays we would go thought foam rolling, some
yoga stretches, and then get into lacrosse ball trigger points, Thera Cane trig-
ger points, and a little Graston technique. A very good book I’ve learnt from is
called The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies and Amber Davies.
Staying on a consistent schedule is crucial for maximizing the benefits of
active recovery. Regularly incorporating these techniques into your routine
Week 8 | 159
ensures that your muscles are always in a state of readiness for the next work-
out. It helps prevent injuries, reduces soreness, and keeps you motivated. The
workouts I design for athletes are usually a four-day split, meaning one day
focused on the upper body with sprints, another on the lower body with con-
ditioning, and then the same again except more single leg movements, quicker
bar speed on lifts, and different recovery methods to create faster, healthier
athletes. By making active recovery a habit, you create a balanced approach
to fitness that supports both your physical and mental health.
MAKE TRAINING BALANCED—TRAIN
HARD, RECOVER WELL, EAT CLEAN
NUTRITION AND RECOVERY
Nutrition plays a pivotal role in the recovery process, especially for dieters
who put their muscles through intense workouts. Proper nutrition ensures
that your body has the necessary building blocks to repair and grow muscle
tissue, replenish energy stores, and support overall health. My go-to muscle
repair is always protein. I used to jump on the bandwagon of all the latest
and greatest amino acids, but, to be honest, I am not good with pills. I know
leucine and glutamine are super important, probably the best muscle build-
ing amino acids out there, and I should just mix it in my protein shakes, but
I just get lazy. My go-to supplement for recovery and just to fill gaps when I
get hungry is protein powder.
Interestingly, when I was training for a 5k run this past spring and just
trying to kill my body with ski erg, rower, and assault bike, I was truly burn-
ing the candle at both ends. I heard talk about a competition called Hyrox,
so I figured I would try some of the events. I started doing brick workouts
where you stack events on top of each other like rowing, runs, ski erg, and
sled push. But I wanted to really push it so I threw the assault bike in there.
My legs felt like bricks during those workouts trying to run after hitting 25,
160 | STRONG AGAIN
50, or even 100 calories on the assault bike. This was my cardio training for
this past show. I have done shows with and without cardio in the past, and
with this show I have yet to do cardio. I am going to start one month out
from a Hyrox competition I signed up for, which is about Week 10 of my
bodybuilding prep.
PROTEIN IS MY MVP FOR RECOVERY
During training for my latest show, I was pushing myself to my limits
and not recovering properly. Having gym partners pushing you can be a great
thing, but when I did my blood work my white blood cells were high and so
were my liver enzymes—all pointing to overtraining. This is your body’s way
of saying slow down because your immune system is getting compromised.
I bought one of those Garmin fitness watches and would check on differ-
ent metrics I knew nothing about, like zone 2 training or HRV. But I got to
learn. Interestingly, psychologically I started to believe what the watch was
telling me instead of how I felt.
MY GARMIN WATCH SPOKE A LANGUAGE I DIDN’T
KNOW, BUT I LISTENED, THEN IGNORED IT
I always push myself even when I am tired, but my watch said to take it
easy and not to train for a day … WTF?! I almost threw it away, but I liked to
keep track of my sleep and the routes I was running for time. At least those
features were neat.
Killing my body with cardio made me learn a lot about recovery. Matt
Green, a professional cyclist in Europe, told me I was definitely pushing it
and needed more vitamins and minerals like they used to get through IV bags
(which are way too expensive here in the States). This would be the only time
Week 8 | 161
I was diligent about taking my vitamin C, multivitamins, vitamin D, milk
thistle, omegas, and other supplements to help support my immune system
and cellular health.
I get it, this stuff gets expensive, and that is why I usually only take it when
I’m training. My goal is to always stay on it, but mentally or financially I am
not there. I stick with what I know and like, and that is protein as my staple,
a vitamin blend from AdvoCare called Spark, and an electrolyte drink called
Rehydrate. I use a pre-workout from a local Walmart, sometimes with stim
and sometimes not. I am over the crap I used during powerlifting that would
make my face itch and cause me to crash hard. I just like a nice, smooth pre-
workout that makes me feel awake. That is why I love AdvoCare’s Spark, as
it has as much caffeine as coffee but doesn’t make your mouth dry.
One of the key aspects of nutrition in recovery is the intake of macro-
nutrients—proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein is essential for muscle
repair and growth. Consuming high-quality protein sources, such as lean
meats, fish, eggs, and plant-based options like beans and lentils, helps to pro-
vide the amino acids needed for muscle synthesis. Carbohydrates are equally
important as they replenish glycogen stores depleted during exercise, provid-
ing the energy needed for your next workout. Healthy fats, found in foods
like avocados, nuts, and olive oil, support hormone production and overall
cellular health.
Schools do not teach kids about proper nutrition, only a version of it
approved by government entities who have been paid off. Why do you think
the food pyramid has changed? And why does orange juice make a good break-
fast? Follow the money. It is hard to listen to overweight general practitioners
or dieticians telling you how many grams of carbohydrates you should get or
how much fruit you should consume each day. Think about 200 years ago
when there was no refrigeration: Did our forefathers and mothers eat fruit all
winter to keep up their health? You can counter that by saying we live lon-
ger these days. But is it because of food or modern medicines like penicillin?
With the prevalence of cancers today, it is hard to argue that foods are
162 | STRONG AGAIN
better. This is a whole different topic of study. The point is, don’t believe
everything you hear. Instead, stick to what others have had success doing.
Yes, I don’t look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dorian Yates, or Ronnie Cole-
man, but my nutrition is based on the same philosophies: lean food, vegeta-
bles, good sources of carbohydrates. Even then I’m making some assumptions
based on what they have publicized about their diets. Having friends and rel-
atives who have been in the trenches has really helped define my path to suc-
cess in bodybuilding. And until you do it yourself, you are just guessing and
wandering around the nutrition world like the village idiot.
IN THE NUTRITION MAZE,
EXPERIENCE TRUMPS TEXTBOOKS
Hydration is another critical component of recovery. Water is involved in
nearly every bodily function, including nutrient transport and temperature
regulation. Staying well hydrated helps to flush out toxins and reduce muscle
soreness. Aim to drink at least a gallon of water throughout the day. Yes, those
guys carrying around their jugs of water at the gym, like “hey look at me,” might
be a little douchey, but it is a good way of ensuring you drink enough water.
I mean, there is a market for huge bottles with time marks on them to ensure
you stay properly hydrated. SMH, just put the water in your overpriced Stan-
ley and drink at least four of those every day. I am not a huge fan of always
drinking water during workouts, because if you need water at that point, you
are definitely not drinking enough throughout the rest of the day. Ask anyone
who actually trains hard and not just a Stanley Mom or Gallon Gary.
We get to play with hydration during the last week of this diet to make
you look phenomenal during your show or event. I can’t spoil it and divulge
all the details now, but it has to do with dehydration, carbohydrates, and
rehydration. Every time I explain this to people, they only hear that part of
my whole bodybuilding journey and forget I just dieted for 12 weeks. I didn’t
Week 8 | 163
look like this on stage just because of water balance! That is just one aspect
you get to do for a couple days in Week 12.
SUPPLEMENTS AND GOOD
HYDRATION ARE GREAT SIDEKICKS
Supplements can also play a role in filling nutritional gaps. While it’s
best to get nutrients from whole foods, supplements like protein powders,
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), and multivitamins can be beneficial,
especially for those with higher nutritional needs due to intense training. I
dial in my supplements more during my show prep, for sure. Yes, we should
be eating clean all the time and supplementing all the time. My goal is to get
jacked and shredded as hell for the stage. The goal for you is to do the same,
but also to take note of what it took to get there and how to approach it in
the future. It will be a learning experience for you. If you ate like shit before,
at least now you will have a better understanding of what you need to do to
stay on a healthy path and not get fat.
There is always a master plan in my head day to day. In the mornings, I
run through every second of my day in terms of what I am going to eat. Usu-
ally, I grab meat snacks, almonds, or protein bars, because my days are very
similar. However, sometimes I’m thrown off course and I need some quick
and easy nutrition. This is where I want you to get to: knowing what to grab
rather than reverting to your old bad habits, like skipping meals, being way
too hungry at night, and then overeating. “But I eat really well,” you may say
as you wash your dinner down with a glass of wine or a beer. This really makes
me shake my head.
SKIP THE LATE-NIGHT BINGES AND ALCOHOL
AND WAKE UP INFLAMMATION FREE
164 | STRONG AGAIN
A well-rounded approach to nutrition, focusing on both macronutri-
ents and micronutrients, is essential for effective recovery. By ensuring your
body has the right fuel, you can optimize muscle repair, reduce soreness, and
enhance overall performance. Remember, recovery is not just about resting;
it’s about providing your body with the tools it needs to rebuild stronger and
be more resilient.
Sleep is the ultimate recovery source from those hard training days. This
is where your body grows and repairs, and the stress hormone cortisol takes
a break. Getting a good night’s sleep will help with muscle soreness for the
next day as well, so skip the alcohol and the late-night carb binges. Wake up
without inflammation and start your day ready to rock again. Whether it is
a hard training day or an active recovery day, keep pushing forward as you
are more than halfway to your goal.

THE FINAL PHASE
Let’s rewind the clock and revisit the path we’ve successfully navigated so
far—the twists, the plateaus, and the moments when doubt whispered in
our ears like a mischievous goblin. Our 12-week diet plan unfolds in three
distinct micro cycles, each revealing new layers of resilience and determination.
Phase 1: The clean slate
The first phase of the program focused on banishing junk foods from
our grocery list and cupboards. Once we cleaned out our pantries, we could
embrace whole foods with a focus on protein as the main source of nutrition.
We now know that protein is the powerhouse for recovery, well-being, and
health, and it takes a heck of a lot more effort to use protein for energy so we
are always keeping that metabolism high. We also calculated our basal meta-
bolic rate (BMR) to find out exactly how many calories we need to maintain,
lose, or gain weight and body composition. This is about nourishing your
muscles and metabolism, not depriving them. We laid the groundwork, till-
ing the untouched soil (for most of you) for what was yet to come.
Phase 2: Carb cycles and doubt shadows
After four weeks of cleaning up our diet, it was time to reevaluate the plan
and introduce more carbs, but only for one day. Carb cycling is like tuning a
musical instrument, alternating between higher and lower pitches to achieve
168 | STRONG AGAIN
perfect harmony. Our muscles crave carbohydrates after being deprived of
them, and our muscles thanked us for filling them up on premium fuel. Pro-
tein will always remain the steadfast companion, but coupling protein with
carbohydrates and a highly sensitive insulin response, our muscles almost pop
out of our skin. But the halfway mark is hard; doubt creeps in. Could we
truly accomplish what we set out to do? We faced those shadows, acknowl-
edged them, and kept moving forward.
RECLAIM YOUR STRENGTH
Phase 3: The grand finale
Here we stand, gazing at the final phase, our commitment unwavering.
Our focus sharpens like a camera lens. Protein takes center stage. We will
learn that healthy fats aren’t foes; they’re allies, fueling our brains and nur-
turing our cells. But real magic comes from setting up our master plan like
we have before. We will tread below our BMR and have the intensity of a
fierce jungle cat. Optimal gains await. “What we do in life echoes in eternity.”
—General Maximus Decimus Meridius
TIME FOR A CHANGE
This next micro cycle will focus mostly on protein. Your ratios will be dif-
ferent to the 40-40-20 that you are used to. Some days you will hit more of
a 60-20-20, i.e., 60% protein, 20% carbs, 20% fat. This is what the master
plan is for and what we need to focus on. Table 9.1 shows my focus for the
next four weeks, and it is pretty much all protein. This plan is only 1,910 cal-
ories and the ratios are what is needed for these last few weeks: 65% protein,
15% carbs, 20% fat.
Week 9 | 169
Along with eating this much protein, you should be drinking a lot of water
throughout the day. This will be the hardest part for any newbies.
I do not put a lot of vegetables in there as I allow myself wiggle room
with those. The foods I eat without much restraint are green beans, broccoli,

cauliflower, deli turkey, and hummus. I don’t put those on my master sheet
because I don’t want to eat those every day, but sometimes I may feel like I
need to eat more, or if I need the extra fat from the hummus, or I just need
more veggies for volume.
With this being the first week of my new plan, I was hungry. I decided to
leave the dinner table after my egg whites and beef, without toast now, and
put my dishes in the dishwasher and start the bedtime routine for me and
my kids. Well, my kids were taking longer as they were finishing up eating
after gymnastics, so I crept into the pantry. I grabbed the pretzels. In the last
phase, I would sit at my chair and eat about half a bag. This time, I pulled
out five pretzels, grabbed some hummus from the fridge, and had a little dab
on each one. Cheating, yes, but will it kill me? No. But it is crucial for these
last four weeks to dial it in and replace the doubts in the back of your mind
with the focus of being on stage.
EMBRACE THE WIGGLE ROOM: NAVIGATING
CHEATS AND TRIUMPHS IN YOUR FINAL PUSH
The first eight weeks have really revved up our metabolism for burning
all three macros as fuel. That is why in these last four weeks we will see the
most gains from our hard-earned work. While cleaning up our diets in the
first four weeks, we were training our metabolisms to be sensitive to carbo-
hydrates and not a glutton for sugar, as we were keeping those at bay. Notic-
ing our bodies were on a better time management clock with food, we were
able to start slowly burning the fats that are unnecessary to carry around, and
the transformation process was beginning.
Phase 2 etched into our metabolism that it could burn even more excess
fat from us because it was getting adequate nutrition throughout the day. Our
body was starting to burn excess fat, as well as the muscle glycogen stored in
our muscles from the carbohydrates. Our metabolism also ramped up its use
Week 9 | 171
of protein for energy as we were getting rid of a lot more carbs than we were
used to having. But we didn’t want to go into total protein usage like a keto-
genic diet, because we still wanted our bodies to burn all three macronutri-
ents effectively and efficiently.
Think of it this way: Your fat self just uses fat as energy because you con-
sume way too many calories. Yes, if you want to get all physiological, your
body burns muscle glycogen first, but we are concerned about you being fat,
and this is how you need to think about it. You never see yourself getting
leaner because you keep consuming too many calories, so now at 30 or 40 you
are fat and lacking muscle, which is to do with your metabolism. You trained
the first four weeks to clean up your diet and become insulin sensitive again.
Now, after those four weeks, you are more effective at burning carbohydrates,
so you can add those in on a carb cycling day in the second phase of the diet.
With your metabolism primed, now it is time to give it a turbo boost.
During this phase, you keep feeding yourself protein as a premium fuel that
your body relies on; your fat and carbs will burn off quickly. You are getting
back to your ancestral roots of hunter/gatherer and relying on meals of unpro-
cessed, high-protein foods with healthy fats and some vegetables.
At this point in the game, nutrient timing is key to avoid any type of mis-
step. If you have something out of the ordinary, you must do it closer to your
workout. At night I always crave popcorn or pretzels, which is why I grabbed
only five pretzels and then put the bag away, otherwise I’d have grabbed the
deli turkey too to scoop up some hummus. Thinking about these things will
help make them possible. Getting ready for bed and brushing your teeth will
curb your appetite and make you realize you are just eating for the sake of it.
Fuel your body through the day so you don’t get hungry at night. As crazy
as it sounds, I struggle with this every day but find ways to work around it:
• I don’t stop at the gas station on the way home.
• I drink diet soda here and there when I am bored instead of think-
ing about food.
172 | STRONG AGAIN
• I eat my egg whites with salsa and plain Greek yogurt.
• I embrace that pang of hunger between meals and don’t lose control.
All these little things help me get over the line during those last four weeks.
Before you know it, the 12 weeks are done and you will not even remember
the last micro cycle. Everyone has their little vice, and for me it is diet soda
and some salsa. For my first few shows, I was so scared of having salsa because
of the little bit of sugar that was in there, so I stayed away from it. But now
I balance regular salsa with diet soda. Pick your poison.
MINDFUL EATING AND HUNGER MANAGEMENT
It is more important than ever during this last phase to be mindful of what
you are putting in your body. I am talking about certain foods that can throw
you off track. I always tell people, “You can’t get fat on protein.” This is so
true; I will die on that hill. The problem is that people eat so much of every-
thing else, protein isn’t really helping them to lose weight at all. It is just add-
ing to their problem of being overweight.
YOU CAN’T GET FAT ON PROTEIN
If you have been following the diet to this point, your body is ready to use
protein as energy. Assuming you have been kicking ass in this plan, protein
will help curb those hunger moments. “You can’t get fat on protein” is truer
now more than ever. Are you hungrier today than yesterday? Good, have an
extra protein bar, or an extra meal shake. You can even have a second and
third helping of chicken, fish, turkey, or beef for all I care. It may not be on
your master plan, but you also aren’t doing that every single day. Therefore,
your body will not get fat on the extra protein you consumed, and it may
just sate your body enough to carry on at optimal levels.
A tell-tale sign of undereating is feeling hungry at night. I know my hunger
Week 9 | 173
patterns well: I’m an every-other-day eater. If I’m not hungry on Monday,
I eat a lot on Tuesday, and less on Wednesday. I discovered this during my
honeymoon at an all-inclusive resort. My wife and I noticed we alternated
between eating a lot and a little each day. This pattern has made me more
conscious of my diet for the past 10 years. Even with a consistent diet plan,
I notice I’m hungrier every other day. On less hungry days, I force myself to
eat to meet my calorie needs.
It might sound odd, but consider this: Most overweight people aren’t
hungry all the time. Our bodies are built for “feast or famine,” designed to
go without food for survival, then gorge when we can. Many people don’t
plan their meals, so skipping one isn’t a big deal. We need to stay aware of
our daily decisions. Having a plan helps us remember what we need to eat.
STAY AHEAD OF YOUR HUNGER
If I eat the same thing every day, I know I’ll be hungrier at night occa-
sionally, if not every other day. That’s why I need to plan these last four weeks
with extra protein and hummus at night to avoid carbs. It’s not that all carbs
are bad, just not right now! I’ve mentioned my nighttime deli and hummus
cravings, but I also crave chicken breast and hummus. The great thing about
these is they don’t trigger sweet or salty cravings, so you can be satisfied and
then head to bed or brush your teeth to signal the end of eating for the day.
Things can get complex at nighttime, and you need to figure it out. Whether
it’s snapping beans while mindlessly watching TV or preparing meals for the
next day, you need a routine to prevent boredom and keep your hand from
creeping toward the pantry. Stay active and prepare for tomorrow, because
the battlefield is your mind, and you need to stick to your plan.
SMART PLANNING
174 | STRONG AGAIN
THE MENTAL FINISH LINE
Right around this time for my last show, doubt was already in my mind and
I was staring at myself in the mirror thinking, Oh shit, I only have four weeks
left. Stay the course, tune out the noise, and stick to what you have been
doing and your plan. Like last time, I have only stepped on the scales twice,
both to show my weight going up. This is no surprise because I am feeding
my body nutrition, and my abs are showing through. It has been a smooth-
ish eight weeks so far, and it is time to tighten up those laces for the last four
weeks, because now it is going to get fun.
Having a protein-rich diet, you will start to notice more vascularity instead
of the “fatscularity” you had before. Instead of checking your weight on the
scales, you may find yourself checking those abs in the mirror more, just to
make sure they are still there or are coming in better. Even today, at the start
of Week 9, I did the JJT (jump jiggle test) and saw the progress from the
previous week. You may not be completely shredded by this point, but you
are on track. You will get there with this diet by Week 12. And if not, it will
come soon after with consistency and effort.
TRUST THE PROCESS
Being a personal trainer and owning a gym for the past 17 years, I have
seen a lot of people come and go. Everyone carries with them hope, encour-
agement, suffering, pain, and insecurities. I had one guy come in who was
really down on his luck and up on the scales, by a lot in both directions. He
was depressed and needed a new lot in life. He was easily 150lbs over weight,
but his goal was to do a bodybuilding show. Well, he stuck to the 12-week
diet for a whole year and lost 100lbs. But it isn’t just about the weight, because
we see people do that all the time and then put it back on. His whole out-
look on life changed. He was getting strong. When he first stepped into the
gym, he had to roll off the bench onto the floor to get up; but he got to the
Week 9 | 175
stage where he competed in his first ever powerlifting meet. He also com-
peted in a bodybuilding show and proved through perseverance and resilience
you can reach your goals if you strive hard enough. But, more importantly,
he found the love of his life and is happily married. When he came to me,
he was divorced, overworked, depressed, and had no direction. I set him on
a course to achieve what he wanted, and he grasped those reins with both
hands and took off.
All things are possible if you take the first steps on the path to a healthy
lifestyle. The first steps for this program were to cut out garbage foods. There
isn’t a magical formula, you know what you are doing wrong. Maybe you
ate well three days in a row and then celebrated with ice cream sundaes and
booze at a local pub. You just put yourself in the back seat and will not reap
the benefits of what you could accomplish.
TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE,
ONE STEP AT A TIME
When I write a program for athletes and adults I train, I always give
them specific numbers to hit. I have the weights listed for each set, knowing
how their bodies will react. The same goes for dieting. We already figured
out your BMR, you know how many calories you need each day to live, to
thrive, and to get shredded. You need to trust the process and stick to the
program you have laid out for yourself. I am just a guide through your jour-
ney; it is up to you to follow your own path. My path will lead to me being
on stage in four more weeks, at time of writing. Maybe your path is to look
great at a wedding or family function, or to control something in your life
so no one else can tell you what to do or not do. Whatever path you choose,
it is the right one.

LEARNING OVER THE YEARS
After high school and into college, my hunger grew for learning more
about training. The programming in high school was coming from
reading muscle and fitness magazines with friends, and coaches who
would say in reference to the power clean, “I don’t know, just pick it up as
fast as you can.” I remember having a pyramid chart on the wall for reps you
should be able to hit at certain percentages of your one-rep maximum. We
would literally just do pyramid workouts for the main lifts like bench, squat,
and deadlift: 12 reps at 70%, 10 reps at 75%, eight reps at 80%, six reps at
85%, four reps at 90% and two reps at 95%.
Learning this way set the groundwork for how the body reacts to lifting.
If you were to bench press or squat 10 reps at 75%, you will realize you will
probably not do that again for your next set, and especially for the sets after
that. You will be gassed. It was crucial to learn the importance of program-
ming by pounding weights at a young age.
The first real programming came once I got into college. Our football
program followed a linear progression model a lot of universities used in the
’90s. Dr. Chuck Stiggins had a comprehensive and sport-specific program for
strength and conditioning (Stiggins & Edwards, 1985). His principles formed
the backbone of many successful strength and conditioning programs in that
decade and beyond.
The Stiggins program focused on periodization, which involved divid-
ing the training program into different phases (e.g., off-season, pre-season,
180 | STRONG AGAIN
in-season) to optimize performance and recovery. The workouts focused on
staple exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and power cleans. The
12-week training program would pick five or six exercises for a Monday,
for example, and then run three micro cycles of training blocks within the
12-week macrocycle.
The Stiggins program is a linear model with progressive overload. At the
beginning of each cycle, we would max out on pretty much each lift we were
doing, so the programming would put in our numbers according to the per-
centages. This way, we had numbers for all our main lifts and not just per-
centages like I listed. The exercises didn’t change throughout the 12 weeks, but
you got stronger and faster by progressing the weights every week. And the
unwritten rule was that if you were to get more than the prescribed weight
on the last set, you needed to go up another five or 10lbs next week on all
those numbers for that lift.
I have based my own techniques and programs on these progressions in
strength training, thanks to coaches like him. This program, along with the
book Periodization Training for Sports (Bompa & Carrera, 1999), set the tone
leading into my internship at the University of Arizona and Graduate School
at North Dakota State University.
“ABSORB WHAT IS USEFUL,
REJECT WHAT IS NOT”—BRUCE LEE
At the University of Arizona, I learned so much more about the different
physiological aspects of progressing as an athlete. Males and females have dif-
ferent training needs, as the angle of the knee is not the same and ACL inju-
ries are more prevalent in females (Poliquin, 2001). Charles Poliquin and his
training methods were widely used, and getting kids to handle weight with
his approach was new to me. Things like warm up, mobility, and hip activa-
tion were introduced as well as foam rolling. These modalities were all new
Week 10 | 181
and opened my eyes to a bigger world than just “stacking plates, pounding
weights, and getting dates.”
I had a hunger to learn. I read The Weightlifting Encyclopedia: A Guide
to World Class Performance by Arthur J. Drechsler. It was dry stuff at times,
but my knowledge of why we do complexes expanded my world of weight
training. To be able to take a complex lift like a power clean and literally cre-
ate five exercises out of it was amazing to me. For example, you can have a
whole workout program just on the movements of the power clean: the pull,
or deadlift if you want to coach it wrong; the Romanian deadlift, or RDL;
shrugs; front squats; and push press or push jerk depending on your goals.
In the back of The Weightlifting Encyclopedia, Drechsler not only teaches the
skills needed for a ton of varieties for complexes, but explains how those com-
plexes are also conditioning exercises for your body to either grow, lean out,
or put on mass. As you progress and become more efficient in those com-
plexes, your body will respond to their amazing benefits.
BY PERFORMING MULTIPLE REPS AND SETS
WITHOUT REST, COMPLEXES INCREASE THE TOTAL
VOLUME OF YOUR WORKOUT, WHICH CAN LEAD TO
GREATER MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY AND FAT LOSS
For example, if you are just learning how to lift weights, you can take an
empty bar or PVC pipe and go through a complex: pull, RDL, shrug, hang
clean, front squat, push press. Now, do each of those movements for six to
eight reps with that empty bar for at least three sets. It is a circuit for your full
body that will challenge ankle and hip mobility, core strength, and your car-
diovascular system, all with just a light weight. Once you can do this without
breathing hard, it becomes a light warm up as your body develops strength.
This is where the groundwork is really set, and you can look back and say,
“Wow, I can’t believe how far I have come” when you can do this complex
182 | STRONG AGAIN
with 45s on each side of the bar. And trust me, if you are doing 45s on each
side of the bar for your warmups, you are strong.
THE PURSUIT OF LEARNING
Learning from Preston Greene, assistant coach in strength, speed, and condi-
tioning for the men’s football team at the University of Arizona for two years
prior to his time with the 49ers program, was a blessing. He was also head
strength coach for the women’s basketball and soccer programs and directed
the department’s nutrition and supplementation program. He followed the
Poliquin principles and is now at Clemson University.
From Coach Greene, I learned about hip activation exercises and knee
stability, but more importantly, the concept of time under tension (TUT).
Greene, a follower of Charles Poliquin, structured his programs to alternate
between accumulation and intensification phases. Poliquin emphasized TUT,
which refers to the total time a muscle is under strain during a set of exercises.
During the accumulation phase, like Stiggins’ program, the focus is on high
volume (total sets x total reps x weight). The intensity of the lifts is less than
80% of your one-rep maximum (1RM), and include seven 30- to 90-second rest
intervals per set. This is similar to the Stiggins program, as the main lifts are 12
and 10 reps respectively, and your rest is limited but enough to recover. When
focusing on bodybuilding, the key is to get at least two or three minutes’ rest.
The intensification phases focus on strength training through neural adap-
tations. This will be using different training techniques focusing on speed
with chains, board bench presses, lockout lifts, heavy eccentrics with weight
release pins, and band work.
I wrote programs using these modalities alongside the head strength and
conditioning coach Brad Arnett, who later became director of a place called
NX Level Performance with owner Joe Panos, a professional football player
destined to help other aspiring athletes reach their goals. I learned a lot from
Coach Arnett on my internship, and I also later worked with him at NX Level
after my graduate work at NDSU.
Week 10 | 183
A LEGEND IN THE FITNESS WORLD
Charles Poliquin introduced tempo variation, altering rep speeds to target
different muscle fibers. By experimenting with various tempos, such as focusing
on the eccentric (lowering) phase or performing explosive concentric (lifting)
movements, athletes can effectively stimulate muscle growth. This approach
allows for a comprehensive and targeted hypertrophy training regimen.
Poliquin also advocated for periodization, a strategy involving planned
cycles to optimize performance and prevent plateaus. By structuring training
into distinct phases, athletes can systematically progress and adapt, ensuring
continuous improvement and peak performance. This method helps man-
age fatigue, enhance recovery, and achieve long-term goals.
During my internship and graduate studies at North Dakota State Uni-
versity, I applied these principles for my first bodybuilding show. Control-
ling time under tension (TUT) ensured muscles were exposed to the right
amount of stress for growth and adaptation. Training athletes all day and
attending school at night limited my sessions to early mornings, so moni-
toring TUT allowed for precise and effective workouts, maximizing results
within a given timeframe. Properly managed TUT also helped avoid over-
training and reduce injury risk.
The most important lesson from TUT workouts is that I remained injury-
free. Lifting felt good again. Although it’s an ego check to bench 185 with a
five-second eccentric tempo instead of 225 or 275 for 10 reps, taking my time
with TUT programming expanded my training knowledge. The methods I use
in all my programming come from years of putting myself through these paces.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE
Graduate school was a great time to broaden my learning and explore some
of the things that I learnt as a high school and college athlete. With my
184 | STRONG AGAIN
internship completed, I was ready to take on the world … and keep learning.
North Dakota State was a great experience as I saw a transition like never
before. It was similar to a coaching transition that I went through at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Eau Claire for football. After two successful seasons with
the Blugolds during my first two years, our head coach Bob Nielson moved
on to bigger and better things, to be replaced by a hard-nosed, ex-defensive
coordinator coach in Todd Hoffner. Coach Hoffner’s first couple years were
a struggle. The team was fractured after Coach Nielson left and a lot of play-
ers quit. But we recovered and did great in my senior year, tying for confer-
ence champs in 2002.
ATHLETES TRAINING IN LARGE GROUPS WILL
NOT HAVE THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS MET
The transition at NDSU was the exact opposite of what I expected. When
I arrived, there was a great team atmosphere in the weight room and testos-
terone-filled hype, but not much actual training. Coach Grogan was very
knowledgeable, but the setup was dysfunctional. Every coach wanted their
team to lift together, making it chaotic to train 55-75 athletes with different
needs and injuries. With so many athletes, most were hiding in the weeds
and not reaching their potential. As a first-year graduate assistant, I witnessed
nine ACL injuries on the team that year. It was horrifying, and the blame
rolled downhill from the head coach to the coordinators, strength staff, ath-
letic training staff, and eventually even the athletic department.
After the first year at NDSU, Coach Grogan was on his way out, and so
were most of the staff for the football team. The head defensive coordina-
tor from Nebraska, Craig Bohl, was on his way in. Even the way he walked
demanded respect, and you gave it to him. How he carried himself reminded
me of Coach Bob Nielson, my original collegiate coach. He flipped that pro-
gram on its heels, and it took off running. Coach Bohl brought in a new head
Week 10 | 185
strength coach, Jim Kraemer. This is where my learning took off to a whole
new level. He was able to implement more personalized training and broke
up the 55-75 athletes throughout the day into small group training sessions.
IT ALL COMES BACK TO THE FARM
College students are on campus all day. Coming from a farm background,
I started working out at 5 am because Coach Kraemer scheduled small groups
for athletes every hour. He managed to train 150-200 athletes at NDSU over
a 12-hour day with his assistant Brad Nordstrom and me, a graduate assistant.
This experience taught me how to schedule off-season and in-season training
programs and manage groups throughout the day. My gym operates simi -
larly; clients have set times, and we adjust workouts as needed.
This approach marked the beginning of NDSU’s success. Each athlete
had a tailored workout plan specific to their position, with small adjustments
made as needed, thanks to personalized small group training.
I learned a lot about hamstring health and agility while addressing ACL
injuries. It was the first time I saw athletes struggle to walk the next day after
simple reaction drills and side-to-side movements. The pieces started to fit
together on how to train athletes for success, not just to be an athlete. Coach
Kraemer was the driving force behind NDSU’s powerhouse team.
Under my original strength coach, John Grogan, I learned a variety of move-
ments using chains, bands, and boards. I also gained insight into the business
side of budgeting for an athletic department, understanding the principle of
“use it or lose it.” The strength department invested in strongman training
equipment, which made my first year an incredible learning experience. We
explored various movement activities to enhance athletic performance, espe-
cially after facing nine ACL injuries, which highlighted the need for change.
When Coach Kraemer joined, he reintroduced the hammer strength jam-
mer presses that we had previously discarded. He had innovative ideas for how
186 | STRONG AGAIN
these could benefit the athletes. Initially, we removed them because Coach Gro-
gan preferred an Olympic-style approach. We also had Scott Safe from Min-
nesota give us a personal seminar for coaching Olympic weightlifting. Coach
Safe is the owner of Safe Strength Systems and has more than 30 years of expe-
rience in weightlifting and coaching. His presentation and performance were so
inspiring that I became passionate about improving my Olympic lifting skills.
EXPAND YOUR EDUCATION
Graduate school was a pivotal point in my life, especially in terms of learn-
ing about training. Before then, I had never worked with chains. When a
classmate in the kinesiology department in undergrad mentioned chain bench
pressing, I had no idea what he was talking about. Back then, we didn’t have
YouTube, and chains and bands were foreign to me. Our training was all about
linear progression and building strength with periodization.
The training at NDSU broadened my horizons, exposing me to various
methods of training athletes. Working with distance runners, wrestlers, bas-
ketball players, soccer players, volleyball players, and even golfers, I learned
many dos and don’ts. For instance, dumbbell reverse lunges are not recom-
mended for an unathletic male golfer. Using 15lb dumbbells without proper
control, I witnessed what a subluxated knee looks and sounds like. It looked
normal because it popped back in, but I initially thought he was a wuss.
I also learned that using a 15kg bar for snatches with women’s basketball
players is not advisable. After a female athlete dislocated her shoulder doing
that, we stopped incorporating Olympic movements for that sport. Not that
it wouldn’t help the athlete become more explosive over time, but we need
to remember they are there to play basketball, and not for Olympic lifting.
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS
Week 10 | 187
FITNESS GEAR SHIFT
It’s not just about training athletes; it’s about communicating with them to
ensure they buy into your program. You need to explain why you’re the best
and why a particular movement benefits them. This isn’t just gym class or a
“workout of the day.” We were training them to perform at the highest level in
their sport while minimizing injury risk. Understanding these various aspects
of sports and people led me to one of my favorite jobs, albeit for a short time.
At Fitness Together, where the motto is “One client, one trainer, one goal,” I
formed important relationships that have lasted more than 20 years.
My time at Fitness Together lasted just one year, but it was packed with
valuable, real-world experience. Working an eight-hour day was a breeze,
often leaving me with plenty of free time. I lived with my cousin, her hus-
band, and their six-month-old baby, so I got to spend a lot of quality time
with them. With the extra time on my hands, I reconnected with my col-
lege duplex neighbor from UWEC, who practiced Hap Ki Do. I had always
wanted to try martial arts, and this was my chance. I began training in Tae
Kwon Do under Master Seung Yuk Ko, who was a fifth dan in Tae Kwon
Do, third dan in Hap Ki Do, and first degree in judo at the time. He now
runs Ko’s Yong-In school in Bartlett, Illinois, and is a seventh-degree black
belt in Tae Kwon Do.
LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCE
I was pushing through the ranks in Tae Kwon Do and training for a sec-
ond bodybuilding show while I was at Fitness Together. The clients I trained
loved seeing the progress each week and month for both ventures, and I
learned about business and relationships from them as much as they learned
about fitness from me. I used my experience of working with so many differ-
ent types of athlete in college and graduate school to find common ground
with this older generation of business owners and private sector clients when
188 | STRONG AGAIN
it came to their goals and training. When it comes down to it, we all want to
be healthier and fitter; we just need a little help along the way.
The owner of Fitness Together loved Paul Chek’s philosophies of train-
ing. Chek’s training philosophies are rooted in a holistic approach to health
and fitness, emphasizing the interconnectedness of physical, emotional, and
spiritual well-being (Chek, 2004). He advocates for corrective exercise that
addresses the root causes of physical issues rather than merely treating symp-
toms. Stress management is a key component of his programs, recognizing
the profound impact of stress on overall health. Chek prioritizes functional
movement patterns that enhance everyday activities and athletic performance,
ensuring that exercises are practical and beneficial for real-life scenarios. Addi-
tionally, he believes in creating individualized training programs tailored to
the unique needs and goals of each person, ensuring a personalized and effec-
tive approach to fitness (Chek, 2001).
HOLISTIC FITNESS: BRIDGING MARTIAL
ARTS, BODYBUILDING, AND PERSONALIZED
TRAINING FOR A HEALTHIER YOU
Our programs at Fitness Together involved a simple linear progression.
We made detailed notes of the movements for each client, which any trainer
could then use to run a workout session with that client. We would run these
programs every four weeks, just like most periodized programs.
When training older people or newbies, you really grasp the idea of start-
ing off slowly. Most of these clients had never trained before, so you cannot
start with the number of prescribed sets and reps. Week one was always about
teaching and training, and why we were doing what we were doing. This
helped so much in developing a vocabulary to make complex workouts or
movements seem easy to comprehend and help the client understand exactly
why they are doing them. Just yesterday, my 64-year-old client said, “I do
Week 10 | 189
more burpees with my two-year-old grandson than I will ever do here.” That
made me happy to hear because fitness is about a life-long journey through
the generations, not just a one-time shot.
I learned a lot more about programming for such clients. Days one and
two were a good mix of focusing on the upper and lower body, and if the
client did come in three or four days that week, we would just do a mix of
day one and day two lifts but change up tempos and rep schemes to keep it
fresh. The philosophy of the Fitness Together owner was to never repeat the
same exercise twice. I asked him how we will know if our clients are pro-
gressing? He didn’t have an answer, but indirectly answered back with the
focus on “functional” strength and always changing things up for the cli-
ents. I left it at that because I didn’t think he could answer the progression
question, when everything I have learned so far was about progress. Come
to think of it, I guess just moving your body and feeling good at a certain
age is progress.
I was happy where I was in my career. Just like any job, there were a few
rubs. Coworkers can be a downer, especially in the fitness industry. Yes, the
hours can get long as you can end up working a forever split shift. But this
job was different: We would work two 6 am-2 pm days, two 12 pm-8 pm
days, one split shift and one Saturday every two weeks. It was easy. We didn’t
have to go out and find clients as marketing did it for us, so we were just
there to train. I had one coworker who complained about everything every
day. It was getting annoying and made it easier to come to my next life deci-
sion. The second, most important lesson I learned working there was that I
am replaceable. Knowing that you are replaceable makes you want to work
harder or realize you need to do your own thing.
EMBRACING CHANGE:
FROM CONTENTMENT TO GROWTH
IN THE FITNESS INDUSTRY
190 | STRONG AGAIN
SHIFTING GEARS AGAIN
I went to the office to talk to Pete, the owner of Fitness Together, and asked
for his professional advice on what I should do after I got an offer of another
job from a local sports performance facility. The opportunity arose to work
with Brad Arnett again at NX Level Performance. He was the head strength
coach at the University of Arizona and moved back to Wisconsin to work
with a startup performance training facility founded by Joe Panos, an ex-
NFL lineman.
There was no beating around the bush, as I knew as well as he did that a
lot of the clients loved working with me, and they would all try to schedule
with me. I asked for a raise to stay with the company or else I would work
with my collegiate coaches and the athletes again at this sports performance
facility. He refused and said if I need to leave, I can just leave. Ouch, that hurt
a little bit, but I am not sure what I was expecting he would say. It was a big
wake-up call and a decision I will never regret. We did have a good conver-
sation about life and goals, so there was no ill will toward Pete or the com-
pany. I just knew I had to move on.
A JOURNEY OF INTEGRITY AND EXCELLENCE
After one year, I left to work with athletes and the general population at NX
Level Performance, a promising startup that would become a premier com-
pany in southeastern Wisconsin. During my time there, I helped train nota-
ble athletes like JJ Watt, Derek Landisch, Matt Berger, Derek Hein, and
many others, starting when they were 12-17 years old. Those guys all contin-
ued training there even as I left to start my own business venture. I take pride
in conducting business ethically and never stealing clients.
My journey led me to train with Brad Arnett once again. One of my for-
mer clients from fitness together checked in on me, and word quickly spread
that I was at NX Level. Some of my one-on-one clients followed me there
without me poaching them, and eventually requested in-home training, which
I still provide 20 years later.
Week 10 | 191
BUILDING ATHLETES, BUILDING CHARACTER
While I was at NX Level I was still training for my black belt in Tae Kwon
Do as well as training athletes. Band run warmups with friends at 4 am
became a personal favorite of mine. Hitting three sets of 90-yard band runs
before starting your Olympic lifts was a great wake-up call for early morn-
ings. I would spend the next year and a half at NX Level honing my skills as
a trainer and expanding my athletic skills in other sports.
While working at NX Level, I learned that Brad is always trying to improve
his programming. Whether this is for professional athletes, youth athletes, or
adults trying to lose weight, he is always talking to other strength coaches and
getting as much input as he can to help deliver the best product out there. It
was great to work with and learn from him.
A TRAINER’S TALE OF DEDICATION AND GROWTH
I was a lone soldier at NX Level, with Brad at the helm and Joe in the
background as the owner. Then, we had a recent graduate come into the stu-
dio looking for a job: Kirk Remer. He was a great asset to NX Level as he
came from a strongman training background with a degree from UW Mil-
waukee and was super eager to learn and help get kids stronger.
Next, randomly through the door one Friday afternoon came Jake Bodi,
a recent graduate from Carroll University looking for a job. I still remem-
ber trying to take him through the ladder so he could learn how to do it. He
looked like a bumbling idiot, but he was there practicing and making him-
self better when no one was watching. That is the difference between those
who are successful and those who fail: the work behind the scenes.
Implementing the programming to make athletes more confident, faster,
and stronger was the easy part. Training ourselves and always wanting to learn
192 | STRONG AGAIN
more was the fun part. Each of us pushed one another to new heights in our
strongman, powerlifting, and Olympic lifting. Neither of those two wanted
to partake in my martial arts training, however.
After about six months at NX Level I earned my first-degree black belt
in Tae Kwon Do, Then, I wanted to try something more lethal. I joined a
local Muay Thai and boxing gym in Waukesha, WI. Oscar Medina was the
head coach for Medina Boxing Club. It was a storybook scene as I walked
up the stairs above a motorcycle shop in downtown Waukesha. It reminded
me of something out of the Rocky series. I joined the Muay Thai camp and
started training there. One thing I quickly learned is how different the kicks
are in Muay Thai and American kickboxing. Power is the name of the game,
whereas Tae Kwon Do is about strategy and accuracy.
My conditioning was top notch for Muay Thai. Doing band runs in the
mornings and implementing a lot of hurdle mobility and hurdle condition-
ing for my hips played a key part in being able to move my legs fast. The one
thing I did not expect from Muay Thai was performing the kicks at maximal
power output, which really put my conditioning to the test. Kicking forearm
targets expends much more energy than kicking hand-clapping targets. Prac-
ticing kickboxing was now combined with training for Olympic and strong-
man lifting with Kirk and Jake.
Kirk and I would push each other by deadlifting and lifting atlas stones at
his house. Most of our workouts were traditional strongman routines, end-
ing with beers and grip work. We had some fun workouts in the basement; I
remember passing out while trying to lift his 380lb stone above the shelf lip.
At NX Level, we set up weight releases for deadlifts, with more than 700lbs
coming down as we worked on speed pulling 600lbs or more back up. I
stood on boxes to get higher for the weight releases to work, and with Kirk
and Jake’s help to lift the first rep and hook the releases on, I would descend
under control until the releases popped off, then pull the lighter weight up
hard. We did this kind of stuff each week just for fun.
While working on snatches, we would do snatch balances off boxes piled
Week 10 | 193
high, all trying to be the first to get under 100kg. Jake was always second to
show up, but he turned out to be the strongest among the three of us. After
months of trying, I was the first to snatch 100kg. As soon as I did, Jake man-
aged it on his very next attempt. The same thing happened with Kirk’s brand
new 425lb atlas stone. Jake struggled with it initially, while Kirk almost loaded
it on his first try. This made Jake determined, and he successfully loaded it
on his next attempt. Jake was incredibly talented and built for strongman
competitions, eventually becoming a pro strongman in both heavyweight
and lightweight categories.
LIFTING STONES AND SPIRITS:
MY PATH TO BUILDING A FITNESS EMPIRE
Strength and lifting have always been the cornerstone of my mindset,
enabling me to achieve anything. As a college athlete in football and track
and field, I deepened my understanding of strength, power, and flexibility
through experiences in strongman, powerlifting, Olympic lifting, and mar-
tial arts. Transitioning to kickboxing was a natural progression for me as I
sought a greater adrenaline rush.
After winning the Milwaukee Rumble, a “Toughman” contest in 2007, I
began training clients who had followed me from Fitness Together in their homes.
This paved the way for me to open my own gym within Coach Medina’s boxing
gym at a new location in Hartland, WI. By paying $400 in rent each month
and leveraging my in-home client base, I was able to grow the business. How-
ever, after a year, Coach Medina announced he was moving out of that location.
With my eyes wide and jaw dropped, I thought, How am I going to afford this?
FROM MOONLIGHT TO MASTERY
I was moonlighting at my new gym Wisconsin Barbell, training in-home cli-
ents as well, and still putting in a few hours at NX Level with one foot out the
194 | STRONG AGAIN
door. What really built my confidence was taking a trip with Brad, Kirk, and
Jake to Elite Fitness in London, Ohio. We learned a lot in a short amount of
time from Dave Tate and Jim Wendler. I mentioned to Jim about my gym
adventure, and that I needed business cards, a website, and all the gadgets
to get started. He looked at me and said, “You don’t need any of that, don’t
waste your time.” He explained how I was the gym, not the equipment or the
fancy marketing. People will come to the gym because of my training, expe-
rience, and background. I will forever be thankful for that advice because
actions speak louder than words when it comes to building kids’ confidence,
and it has all been word-of-mouth.
After seeing the size of Dave and Jim, I wanted to get that jacked and
dived deeper into powerlifting. Dave followed a bodybuilding diet with help
from Justin Harris, a nutrition coach and bodybuilder, owner of Troponin
Nutrition. Jim’s advice about getting super strong by following another elite
lifter’s program resonated with me. I realized the point of this book is to
follow what works. I’m no elite bodybuilder, and I often stumble with cal-
orie restriction, but I’m always learning and trying new things to improve.
I understand that bodybuilding is built in the off-season, and that needs to
be my focus.
BUILDING CONFIDENCE AND STRENGTH
When someone asks me who are the most successful people to come
through my gym, I always respond with one of the first kids I trained, Bran-
don Bucholtz. He was a chubby, non-athletic sixth or seventh grader who did
not play sports. He did the programs, liked to talk a lot, and slowly started
seeing progress. Why was he successful? Because he went from being afraid of
doing any sports to a three-sport athlete by the time he was a senior in high
school. He did cross country, volleyball, and track and field. After high school
he was involved in intermural sports at Tufts University School of Dental
Week 10 | 195
Medicine in Boston. He ended up running in the Chicago and Boston mar-
athons, all the while getting his doctorate of dental medicine.
Being an inspiration for these kids and being a guy that is still in the
trenches gives me a purpose. I remember Dave saying he didn’t like to give
out too much powerlifting advice after he stopped doing it himself. And it
is amazing how these skills as athletes are perishable, and you begin to forget
how exercises “feel” as you are not doing them all the time. This has pushed
me to always try new things and to keep pushing my body to its limits.
I got deep into powerlifting between 2010 and 2014. This was a fun time
because a few of the kids I trained as teenagers were now young men out of
college looking to different careers like firefighting. We all motivated each other
lifting and doing sprints. Having a monolift at the gym brought some guys up
from Monster Garage in Kenosha. I learned more and more about squatting,
deadlifting, and benching from these guys. Mainly, I think I learned more
about how much pain your body can endure lifting this heavy all the time.
I got my gym lifts to 675lb deadlift and squatting more than 735lbs with
briefs. I was able to get a raw bench up to 455lbs. After enduring pain and
seeing the back end of drug use within the powerlifting community, I decided
to get back into bodybuilding. I have mad respect for the guys who are pow-
erlifting and fighting their own demons that most people will never under-
stand, but it wasn’t for me. And truly it is about finding the right crowd of
people to train with to keep you motivated.
Training for another bodybuilding show and trying to get bigger, I ended
up hurting myself doing seated military presses. On the third rep of 275lbs,
my neck popped. I have been injured many times before with shoulders pop-
ping or chest straining from losing form on the bench press, but never any-
thing in my neck while doing a military press.
STRENGTH, PAIN, AND NEW BEGINNINGS
Within one week, my bench press went from 455lbs to 135lbs with an ugly
twist getting it up. I pinched a nerve and jacked up my shoulder and lat on
196 | STRONG AGAIN
my left side. I remember sitting at the local pizza hut after training with a
friend of mine, Jason Eisenman, and asking about what we were going to
do this weekend. I literally had no plans and knew that training was in the
garbage for now. So, I said, “I think I am going to go to the airport to learn
how to fly.” And that is exactly what I did. Flying was a fun adventure, but
it was also frustrating trying to control the yoke with minimal strength in
one arm.
Once one goal is finished, I move on to the next. Or if the goal can-
not be accomplished, time to make a new goal. This is why lifting and my
personality go together like peanut butter and jelly. After getting injured
and being in a dark place for a few weeks, I switched gears, took on fly-
ing as my new passion, and got back into Tae Kwon Do. I was still lifting,
albeit frustrated with the limits on what I could do. I got my friend Jason
to do a Toughman contest in 2015 and he also did a bodybuilding show
after that, then ran a marathon later that year. We all have a screw loose,
don’t we? Jason is a prime example of a young man I used to train at NX
Level, and we reconnected at a local parade of all places. We started hang-
ing out and training together. He has been and continues to be an impor-
tant part of my story.
I got Jason into a firing range for a new challenge when we weren’t training
as much on the weekends. We ended up taking courses at a local place called
Fletcher’s. We continued to get certified in holster, pistol, and AR courses
until life got busy with my business. Jason ended up loving it so much he
is now working there. It is fun to see such progression. I love it when I help
inspire others and they inspire me to keep pushing.
FROM TRAINING ATHLETES
TO INSPIRING LIVES
I mentioned earlier the athletes I trained at NX Level. The most successful
ones aren’t necessarily professional athletes; they’re the ones who grow up
to be good people, outstanding members of society, and responsible family
Week 10 | 197
members. It’s incredibly gratifying when some of these athletes reconnect
with me and return to the gym as adults, now dads or moms.
I see others, like my friend Rachel Martell, a collegiate hockey player and
nurse, who continue to pursue fitness passionately and give me shout-outs
on Instagram for where it all started. Another example is Mimi Bradley, a
collegiate softball player now attending Med School at Kansas State, who
excels in marathons and trail runs, making fitness a core part of her identity.
Athletes like Derek Hein and Matt Berger, whom I mentioned earlier,
have also returned to my gym—Matt to train for college hockey and help out
with training at the gym during summer season; Derek simply because we
ran into each other at the local park with our kids whom also played hockey
and lacrosse at the collegiate level.
LIFE SHIFTING ONCE AGAIN
Flying for me was a short interlude after a crisis prompted by not being
able to lift heavy. Once I got my private pilot license, I started to work on
my instrument rating, which allows you to fly with certain rules using only
your instruments and not just seeing out your window. This is where it gets
much more expensive because for an instrument rating, you are required
to fly a certain amount of times to stay current, and at the time my wife
and I were thinking about kids. I needed to switch gears again and start
paying down debt and saving money for retirement instead of flying for
“fun.” I was back to lifting early in the mornings, which set me up for an
all-day adventure earning money and still left time to enjoy Tae Kwon Do.
I got back into Tae Kwon Do under distinguished martial artist Ed Kahle,
a student of Great Grandmaster Chom Son Cho. He has achieved the rank of
sixth degree Kukkiwon black belt, which is a testament to his skill and com-
mitment. Master Kahle’s journey in martial arts reflects the high standards
and rigorous training imparted by Great Grandmaster Cho. His achieve-
ments and dedication continue to inspire many students at Cho’s Martial
Arts, including me, even after he retired in 2021.

FROM SETBACKS TO COMEBACKS,
THE POWER OF FITNESS AND FRIENDSHIP
One day, the dad of two girls I used to train when they were in grade school
walked into the gym and asked if he could participate in a bodybuilding show,
sparking my need to write this book.
Back when I was training his two girls for soccer about 14 years ago, Todd
was busting his butt as an HVAC guy working in some of the harshest win-
ter conditions Wisconsin has to offer. Todd is made of strong stuff and not
much seems to bother him. The story unfolded that he was forced to retire
five years previously because he got shocked with 600 volts of electricity while
working. After numerous doctor visits and taking several medications to deal
with the nerve pain and help him sleep at night, Todd turned to exercising
outside so his wife didn’t have to hear him moan and groan trying to get past
the pain and discomfort.
The doctors said he would never lift again. But this was not the end for Todd.
He found ways to push through the pain and started dropping the extra pounds
and gaining the confidence to keep moving forward. He was finally able get off
one medication, and then another. He still takes one medication for the pain
just to get a few hours of sleep each night. Working out became his lifeline.
Todd walked in the door and said, “People at the gym said I should do a
bodybuilding show, and you are the only guy I know that did that stuff.” I
replied, “Yeah, you look pretty good. How much do you weigh?” He told
me he was about 173lbs. I said, “I can get you there. I will need 12 weeks,
and by the end you will be 143lbs.” After looking up local shows, we found
the Shredded Cheddar show in Waukesha, WI. I said, “Shoot, if there is 12
weeks until the show, I will do it with you.” I looked at the calendar and it
was exactly 12 weeks. I said, “Shit, looks like the diet starts Monday. Write
down your foods for the rest of the week.”
INSPIRING EACH OTHER
AND OVERCOMING ADVERSITY
Week 10 | 199
This is exactly what I needed too. Todd thought he needed me to achieve
his goals, but I needed him just as much to get back on stage and prove to
myself that I could still do this, despite my lopsided pec and lat from an
injury 10 years ago. I’ve learned that nothing in life happens perfectly or at
the perfect time. This was the moment, and Todd and I were going to start
this journey together.

TIME MANAGEMENT
Creating a weekly schedule is essential for balancing your commitments
and ensuring you make time for your workouts. At the beginning of
each week, take some time to map out your schedule, including work
commitments, family activities, and workout sessions. This helps you visualize
your time and identify potential conflicts. Allocate specific times for your work-
outs, just like you would for any other important appointment. Consistency is
key to forming a habit, so make sure to stick to these designated times as much
as possible. By planning ahead and setting specific times for your workouts,
you can effectively manage your time and stay on track with your fitness goals.
“IF YOU ARE FIVE MINUTES EARLY,
YOU ARE 10 MINUTES LATE”
I’ve always made it a habit to train very early in the morning. I’m that
early bird who catches the worm. My brother, a retired US Marine Corps
gunnery sergeant, often reminded me of a crucial bootcamp rule: “If you’re
five minutes early, you’re 10 minutes late.” I believe Vince Lombardi also
emphasized this principle. Both the Marine Corps and Lombardi live by
ideals to aspire to.
Training later in the day may be better for some, and it may have been for
me once as I used to do that before bigger responsibilities like a wife, kids, and
204 | STRONG AGAIN
paying bills came into play. There is only so much time in the day to get every-
thing done, but if you are passionate about something, you will find a way.
When I first started training clients at my gym, I told myself I would only
start their sessions at 6 am. I figured I had my own shop now and I wasn’t
going to train them any earlier. I would work out for an hour beforehand,
and that meant I could still get a healthy seven or eight hours of sleep each
night. Well, clients kept coming in earlier and interrupting my workouts
because they had to get to work earlier. Instead of shutting the door on them
and hiding like I thought about doing, I just kept coming in earlier. Yes, I’d
have preferred not to, but I figured it’s okay to make adjustments here and
there because I’m competing against six other similar gyms within a three-
mile radius, and we are not a huge town by any means. Have you ever noticed
that there seems to be a gym at every corner in every town, yet we are still the
fattest, unhealthiest country in the world?
SCHEDULE MEETS COMMITMENT
As the sole owner of my gym, I have a clear understanding of the finances,
knowing where the money comes from and how it’s spent each month. I’m
willing to allow some flexibility for my clients to keep them happy. However, if
there’s any abuse, I will address it. A client who is chronically late or shows up at
sporadic times is a challenge for personal trainers because they lack consistency.
Just as with the master plan, I suggest you use a similar approach as a guide.
Consider your entire 12-week plan, including your diet, work schedule,
and family events. Everything has a schedule, and if you can’t manage yours,
this book might be what you need. Start your day by making your bed and
completing one simple task after another. Even if the day turns chaotic, at
least you can come home to a nicely-made bed.
I started training at 5 am during my powerlifting and strongman days,
which meant waking up at 4:30 am to get to the gym right at opening. I
Week 11 | 205
thought to myself, I’ll show these clients for showing up early. After about a
month, I realized I was tired, yawning, and not feeling motivated to cheer on
clients when I had just woken up 30 minutes ago. It sucked!
FROM DAWN TO DONUTS
To make matters worse, my diet was terrible. In my quest to gain strength,
I combined heavy weightlifting with a diet of pizzas and donuts, which left me
feeling awful every morning. It was a complete disaster. I can’t even recall how
many months I kept this up. It was likely the entire time my first coworker,
Kirk Remer, was helping me at the gym before he moved on to open his own
powerlifting and strongman gym in a nearby town.
I’ve always had someone helping me at my gym, whether it be aspiring
gym owners or college and high school athletes. I’ve always told them if they
are good at what they do, they should start their own place and not work for
someone else. I would love to pay someone a lot to work here, but it’s a dou-
ble-edged sword. I don’t charge a lot to train with me, so if it isn’t a good fit,
you can be on your way. It works well for everyone to not be locked into a
contract.
WAKE YOUR @SS UP!
When I work out before I start training clients, my mornings are great,
and my clients appreciate seeing someone energetic and ready to go. Sure,
not everyone is thrilled about early mornings, but consider the alternative. I’d
rather walk into a place feeling like I want to go back to bed, only to be awak-
ened by whatever music is playing. At my gym, that could be anything from
AC/DC to Rob Zombie. One morning, I even played Sea Shanties because
one of the kids I trained, who attends MIT, mentioned he was into them.
206 | STRONG AGAIN
Fast forward to having had years and years of training at 4 am under my
belt, I now get in the gym by 3:30 am because my intern tries to beat me here.
I am seeing the benefit of coming in a little earlier now because I can work
out more if I am rocking right away at 3:30 am. I allow myself some wig-
gle room so I still have a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour to get a good
workout session in even if I have to do a few chores like fold the gym tow-
els. And again, this is only for Monday through Friday. The point is, make
it work for you.
PRIORITIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY
Prioritizing your tasks is crucial for effective time management. Start by
identifying which tasks are most important and need to be done first. You
can use a priority matrix to categorize tasks into urgent, important, and less
critical. This helps you focus on what truly matters. Look for opportunities
to combine activities, such as going for a bike ride or long walk around the
neighborhood with your family so you spend time with them while exer-
cising. This is Week 11, so remind your family that you are only two weeks
away from your goal.
Using time management techniques like time blocking can further enhance
your productivity. Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities
throughout the day. This helps you stay focused and ensures you have ded-
icated time for workouts. I have more than 100 clients come through my
doors each week, and the successful ones are the early birds or the ones who
block off times from work during the day for a “health and wellness” meet-
ing. Take a break from a stressful day and do what you need to do to reset
your mental state or boost your dopamine levels.
Lastly, be flexible and adaptable. Life can be unpredictable, so be prepared
to adjust your schedule when necessary. If you miss a workout, find another
time to fit it in. Stay positive and focus on progress rather than perfection.
Week 11 | 207
Celebrate small victories and stay motivated even if things don’t always go
as planned.
THIS ISN’T FOR ME, THIS IS FOR YOU
NUTRITION BEYOND THE BASICS
Hydration should play a major role in your nutrition. Hydration is a cru-
cial component of any diet because it supports numerous bodily functions
essential for overall health and fitness. Proper hydration helps regulate body
temperature, maintain joint lubrication, and facilitate digestion and nutrient
absorption. It also aids in muscle recovery and performance, which is par-
ticularly important for those engaged in intense physical activities like body-
building. Additionally, staying well hydrated can help control hunger and
prevent overeating, as thirst is often mistaken for hunger. By ensuring ade-
quate water intake, you can optimize your body’s functions, enhance your
physical performance, and support your dietary goals effectively.
One of my favorite supplements of all time that riles parents is creatine.
It is one of the most well-researched supplements available and is widely
regarded as safe and effective for most individuals. I started using creatine
in seventh grade when my uncle bought me a “cybergenic” kit that came
with a VHS tape and powder or pill form of creatine. Even if it didn’t work
physically, it motivated me to get jacked like my childhood heroes and start
pounding the weights.
INSPIRATION CAN TAKE MANY FORMS
Ever since I started on the path of “yoke,” I loved trying any new supple-
ments, or at least new to me. I remember in high school it was creatine, then
by sophomore year we were using amino acids the size of horse pills. Next
208 | STRONG AGAIN
came vanadyl sulfate capsules because they help muscle growth somehow. I
think pyruvate was in there at some point. The only thing I remember from
my nutrition classes on the Krebs cycle was that it included a lot of the sup-
plements I was using. Riboflavin and tribulus terrestris were big ones in high
school as well, but the overarching supplement we always knew about was
testosterone. We always wanted to try it out because it was going to make us
the next Arnold Schwarzenegger, even though he used to say he never took
steroids. Haha! How naïve were we, but then again, we were from a small
town in Wisconsin.
It was probably a good thing for us at that age to have such child-like inno-
cence, like believing Santa Claus is real. When college came around, we were
trying out new supplements sold at local vitamin shops, like ephedra, andro-
stenedione, Andro-6, Androstat 100—basically all the supplements Mark
McGwire claimed he was taking when he said he wasn’t using steroids. I just
remember that whole baseball scandal. There’s a huge difference between ste-
roids and over-the-counter supplements.
HE’S GOT TO BE ON SOMETHING
The first “real” testosterone boosters I tried were Deca-Durabolin (Deca)
and Dianabol (Dbol), and it was after my car accident in 1998. That summer
of training before the football season started, I noticed a recent graduate from
high school was always lifting and a lot bigger than he was in high school.
I had never used performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) before; I was just a
big farm kid who busted his ass. I specifically remember asking him at the
drinking fountain, “Damn Mike, what have you been using?” He said, “You
tell me what you have been using and I’ll tell you what I have.” After miss-
ing a year of football and track at college, I needed to get back into shape for
the upcoming season. I told him I was on the normal creatine, aminos, and
some Dbol that my brother’s friend was using in the Marine Corps. I made
Week 11 | 209
it up, but it was believable as I was one of the bigger guys in a small town.
He told me what he was on and where to get it. The next thing I knew, I was
mailing $300 wrapped in aluminum foil and a birthday card to some place
in Brazil, hoping I would get my ampules of Deca and Dbol. I knew Arnold
used those according to his book, so I should too (Schwarzenegger, 2012).
I used testosterone-boosting supplements all summer, but my morals made
me quit a week before the season started, so I was clean for the season. Stopping
suddenly wasn’t doctor-supervised or recommended. These substances cause
a lot of water retention. During a football practice during two-a-days, I lost
11lbs of water weight in two hours. That night, it was so bad I couldn’t sit on
my couch without my hamstrings cramping or straighten my legs without my
quads cramping. It was a horrible experience, and I would never recommend
doing anything that reckless without guidance from an experienced practitioner.
That was the only time I used a banned substance through my college career.
I am not sure if caffeine and ephedrine were banned, but we all used them.
I guess that is the benefit of going to a Division 3 college: They do not test
unless you are in the top tier. The rest of my career was solely fueled by grit
and a passion for lifting and learning. Beyond college, I dabbled in testoster-
one-boosting supplements when I was powerlifting in my early 30s. When a
friend of mine contacted me from Monster Garage and said he had a buddy
coming to my area looking to use my monolift, I said sure, have him swing
by. His name was Brendan Luedtke. He was at the prime of his powerlifting
career, squatting 1,065lbs, deadlifting 800lbs, and benching around 600lbs.
He was helping me out with techniques and tips for lifting heavier. This was
similar to having someone like Dave Tate at my gym. I was soaking up as
much knowledge as I could. This led me to ask, “What are you on?” Bren-
dan rattled off his regimen like nothing: HGH (human growth hormone),
win (Winstrol), test (testosterone) and tren (trenbolone).
CRASH COURSE ON TESTOSTERONE
210 | STRONG AGAIN
People often think I have mirrors in my gym to admire myself. But the
truth is, I use them for about 15 seconds to identify what needs correction
or improvement. There’s a term called body dysmorphia, which can relate to
muscle dysmorphia. It’s a mental health condition where you’re excessively
preoccupied with perceived flaws in your appearance, believing you’re never
big or strong enough. I used to constantly compare myself to others. While
I don’t have body dysmorphia to a debilitating extent, I choose not to skip
workouts. When my wife and I go on vacations, we’re relaxed and lazy, but
we still find a fitness center or local gym to get some movement in. Most peo-
ple don’t realize how good it feels to feel good. They go day to day without
knowing the joy of waking up without pain and getting the blood pumping.
“WHO IS MORE FOOLISH, THE FOOL
OR THE FOOL WHO FOLLOWS HIM”
—OBI WAN KENOBI
I remember Brendan giving me the syringe and watching me inject tes-
tosterone for the first time. It was quite easy with him watching me because
I didn’t want to be a wuss. I pushed it in like a local injection at the hospital
and continued my day. He said, “Alright, take 1cc twice a week for a couple
weeks and then add 1cc of tren.” I just followed along because it seemed like
he knew what he was doing.
I kept a record of weights for bench press. The bench is a good gauge,
because you can either press it up, or you can’t. The week before my first injec-
tion I could do 275lbs for eight reps, then seven, then six reps for my three
sets. The next week I could do nine reps, nine reps, then seven reps. Having
a good background in training and using a lot of other supplements over the
years, I knew how the placebo effect worked. But this was different. By week
three I was able to hit 295lbs for the same number of reps. And I was floored
the week after when I did 315lbs for 11, 10, and 10 reps.
Week 11 | 211
IT FEELS GOOD TO FEEL GOOD
Being on high levels of testosterone gives you an amazing feeling of super-
human strength. You also feel like you are floating and have an overall sense
of well-being, like having a big stretch and a loud yawn. You just feel good.
But like anything else, we want more. I did that cycle for about 12 weeks and
then it was time to try something else, or something better. I wanted to try
some designer drugs like Winstrol. It was supposed to get me “dry” and cut
up but super strong. I coupled that with the testosterone I was taking along
with Anavar, another potent strength-building supplement.
My squats were getting better and better each week as 685lbs felt easier,
then 735lbs was no problem in double ply briefs, then 775lbs. My buddy and
I went to train with the guys down at Monster Garage to see what it was about.
I attempted more than 900lbs on my squat, hit depth, and then passed out. I
woke up with a massive nosebleed and blood splattered between my feet. The
whole gym came over to the rescue, so I didn’t die that day. The mindset is
different when you are on performance enhancing drugs. It isn’t a “rage” like
most people want you to believe; more of a “I can do anything” type of feeling.
For the couple times I was on steroids, I wanted to get stronger and big-
ger; bodybuilding was never the goal, it was pure vanity. Every competition I
entered for boxing, martial arts, powerlifting, strongman, or bodybuilding was
always “natty,” or natural and not performance enhanced. I mean, the whole
point of PEDs is to enhance your performance, but I only saw it as getting
bigger and looking like those characters on the big screen I admired as a kid.
EVERYTHING COMES WITH A PRICE
All this costs money. I was trying to balance working my nuts off starting
a business with keeping other things afloat, so I didn’t have money to be on
these cycles for long. I ended up trying to do one physique show on drugs. It
212 | STRONG AGAIN
was my first time doing a physique show and my first time using a different
steroid called Masteron. Brendan said it would make me super dry and hard
for the contest. I only had three weeks to prepare and wanted to be in the best
shape I could. This drug had the complete opposite effect, and I gained 20lbs
of water weight in a week. It took me two weeks of trying to only eat protein
and dehydrate to lose most of that. I ended up 27th out of 28 with the over-
all judges concluding that I was not conditioned enough. Yes, I looked bet-
ter than most people on the street, and if I put that picture up on the ’gram
everyone would say good things mostly; but in the end, it was horrifying. I
was pissed about the drug more than anything.
After that show I just switched gears into powerlifting. I was getting stron-
ger everywhere, but also bigger. My goal was to get to 300lbs, and I was near-
ing that. At 283lbs, I was doing military presses with another friend at a local
Gold’s gym. I twisted on my third rep and felt that awful neck pop. That’s when
things went south for me lifting, and that chapter in my life quickly ended.
SWITCHING GEARS, AGAIN
I stopped taking all illegal supplements and just stuck with protein and
getting back to being an athlete again. My knees hurt so bad walking up and
down stairs because I’d neglected the health of my body, mind, and soul while
I took the steroids. I stopped chasing numbers and got back to the basics of
eating right, foam rolling, flexibility, and lifting to feel good again. It was
demoralizing at times but, overall, it was great to finally feel normal again
when I took my shirt off and flexed in the mirror. I can still tell to this day
my pec and lat are a little smaller, but it’s way better to feel good.
EVERYONE IS FIGHTING A BATTLE
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
Week 11 | 213
My wife and I have three kids: Brooklyn, 5, and twins Mia and Liam, 4.
I would do anything for them and to protect our family. While my wife and
I love each other and share similar goals, we often bicker over daily matters
that seem trivial to one but significant to the other. These “nothing” fights
lead us to say hurtful things. Despite this, our core values remain strong and
unshakable, but we need to stop these pointless arguments.
A year and a half ago, I felt mentally and physically drained, despite my
commitment to the gym and training. Our “nothing” fights became routine,
and though we made up, it wasn’t healthy. We needed to talk openly about
our issues. Instagram’s fake lives made me feel inadequate, unable to make my
wife’s dreams come true, exacerbating my body dysmorphia and that feeling
of never being good enough. This left me defensive and unable to show love,
which affected my wife too. I was losing my fire and spirit.
For two nights a week, I would get home later than normal from work.
Not knowing what I was coming home to, I would circle the subdivision
before parking in the garage to avoid hearing my wife scream at the kids or
me. Each day felt different, and I needed a boost to get through.
I discussed with one of my clients his struggles with bad sleep, constant
pain, and weight loss, as well as my emotional stress and depression. I sug-
gested testosterone, recalling how great I felt when I used it. He proposed we
do it together, and I agreed to investigate it. I remembered my friend Kirk eas-
ily getting a Ritalin prescription for focus issues. I thought I’d need to lie to
get testosterone, but realized these issues are more common than I expected.
Out of the multitude of dysfunctions in dealing with low testosterone,
the ones that struck me the most were the emotional and cognitive changes.
I’d always had this feeling of anxiety or depression and irritability. Maybe it
stemmed from my own personal feelings of always trying to achieve some-
thing, but not knowing is the hardest part.
For some reason, my wife and I compete at everything we do. When we
first started dating, we participated in bodybuilding shows and would jokingly
call each other fat or complain about needing to lose more body fat. It was
214 | STRONG AGAIN
cute at first, but we’re both cut from the same cloth when it comes to body
dysmorphia and we were both putting up walls to hide our true insecurities.
BACK ON THE SADDLE
I wanted to get back on testosterone to have that “good” feeling again.
Before contacting an online hormone doctor, I tried contacting Brendan, my
old powerlifting friend. I didn’t get hold of him so asked another friend in the
community if I could get Brendan’s number. “I am sorry to say that Brendan
died five years ago,” he said. At age 35, the guy that was deadlifting and squat-
ting more than a house had passed away. I found out he had many demons,
as a lot of the powerlifters I met do. May he rest in peace, and I thank God I
didn’t go down that path any further with my addictive personality, or I may
have found myself in that same place.
My client and I went to a cookie-cutter testosterone doctor and paid the
entry fee to get a checkup and blood work. I say “cookie cutter” because they
were all pretty much the same online, though we didn’t really know that at
the time. The checkup was a joke. It was a telemedicine appointment, and
he just made us look up, down, side to side, and asked if we had any pain.
That was it. It was that easy to get our testosterone.
I was watching a bunch of YouTube interviews on testosterone and came
across and good one with Mark Bell’s Power Project. I have a ton of respect
for Mark Bell and his brother Chris who made a documentary on steroid use
in sports called Bigger, Stronger, Faster (Bell, 2008). He is a standup guy who
loves the sport and loves helping kids train and in life. He is also friends and
training partners with Dave Tate from his Westside Barbell days.
Dr. Michael Wittmer was being interviewed with his son Jeff, both of
whom were Olympic weightlifters (Bell, 2001). The next day I contacted Jeff
and sent him my labs. He called me back after two minutes and said, “Glen,
they didn’t run shit on you. They did a $20 cholesterol test that you paid
Week 11 | 215
$200 for.” He waived my fee to go through him and his dad, and I switched
the next day. Since then, I have been on testosterone, prescribed through my
doctor at .9ml per week. This is much lower than I was using before without
doctor supervision and without blood work.
GUIDANCE FROM PROFESSIONALS
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) immediately improved my mood.
While this could partly be due to the placebo effect I often experience with
new treatments, the low dose didn’t just push me to lift more weights; it pro-
vided mental stability. This led to a more consistent mood, reducing emo-
tional instability and mental anxiety. As my anxiety decreased, I became more
confident and assertive. It felt similar to when I used steroids in the past, but
this time my purpose was different—focused on health rather than ego. TRT
is somewhat akin to women using birth control pills, as both involve hor-
mone administration to achieve desired physiological effects.
DIAGNOSE AND TREAT COMPLEX HORMONE-
RELATED DISORDERS USING A HOLISTIC APPROACH
One of my clients uses TRT to balance her testosterone and estrogen lev-
els, which is crucial for overall hormonal health and enhances sleep quality.
Using a qualified hormone replacement doctor is key to finding out your
specific needs. Most general practitioners will not know about hormones,
especially testosterone. Testosterone is not just about gaining muscle. There
are so many more benefits. You need to do your own research to establish if
you truly need it. It took me 25 years to let go of my ego and do this for my
health rather than anything else. And I am grateful to be treated by a doc-
tor who knows all about hormones, prostate, cholesterol, liver and kidney
216 | STRONG AGAIN
function, and looks at the body as a whole system rather than just separate
parts here or there.
I did my last show while on TRT. After not doing a show for more than
12 years, I was proud to step back on stage looking the same as I always have.
I am currently training for a show using only multivitamins, DHEA, and
HCG that my doctor had prescribed to bring my sperm count back up. This
is for the possibility of having another child. My wife and I are leaving it up
to God to bless us with another one. So, I am stepping away from testoster-
one once again to try this out. But fingers crossed I will be on it again with
good news in the near future.
STAYING MOTIVATED
AND GOAL SETTING
Setting goals that are SMART—specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,
and time-bound—is crucial for a successful 12-week bodybuilding diet. These
goals provide a clear roadmap, ensuring that each step of your journey is well-
defined and purposeful.
• Specific: You know exactly what you want to achieve, such as los-
ing a certain amount of body fat or gaining muscle mass.
• Measurable goals allow you to track your progress and make nec-
essary adjustments, keeping you motivated and on track.
• Achievable goals ensure that your targets are realistic and attainable
within the 12-week timeframe, preventing frustration and burnout.
• Relevant goals align with your overall fitness objectives, ensuring
that your efforts are focused and meaningful.
• Time-bound goals create a sense of urgency and commitment, help-
ing you stay disciplined and consistent throughout the diet.
Week 11 | 217
Together, these elements make your goals more structured and attainable,
significantly increasing your chances of success.
IF YOU DON’T WRITE IT DOWN,
IT DIDN’T HAPPEN
Tracking your progress has never been easier. I use my Garmin watch to
log sets, weights, and cardio, which helps me stay motivated by aiming to
beat past records. Despite this, I still enjoy writing my workouts on paper
for a tangible feel and a comprehensive view of my training cycle, much like
a movie storyboard.
Here are some other ideas to track your progress:
• Use a Journal or Planner: Write down your goals, tasks, achieve-
ments, and your meals. This helps you see your progress over time.
• Digital Tools: Message yourself on your phone for a simple to-do
list to keep track of your tasks and deadlines.
• Set Milestones: Establish key milestones for each of these four-
week micro cycles.
• Review Regularly: Keep track of what you’ve accomplished and
what still needs to be done by taking photos and reviewing them.
Adjust your master plan as necessary.
• Graphs and Charts: Visual representations of your progress can be
very motivating. Consider using graphs or charts as well as photos
to track your achievements.
• Feedback Loop: Regularly seek feedback from others and reflect on
it. This can provide new insights and keep you motivated.

As you approach the last two weeks of your diet, it’s crucial to stay focused
and resilient. Setbacks can happen, but they don’t define your journey. Embrac-
ing a positive mindset and learning from any challenges will help you stay on
track and achieve your goals.
Reflecting on what caused the setback is crucial as it helps you understand
the triggers and avoid similar situations in the future. Reframing your mind-
set is equally important; instead of viewing a setback as a failure, see it as a
learning opportunity. Setting small, achievable goals can make the remain-
ing two weeks more manageable by breaking them down into daily or weekly
tasks. Celebrating small victories along the way can keep your motivation
high. Staying positive through practicing constructive self-talk and reminding
yourself of the progress you’ve made is essential. Surround yourself with sup-
portive people who encourage and uplift you. Planning and preparing your
meals and snacks ahead of time can help you avoid impulsive eating. Keeping
high-protein snacks handy can prevent cravings from derailing your progress.
YOU MADE IT 10 WEEKS: CELEBRATE THE VICTORIES
It’s time to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. With two weeks
left in the diet, I keep myself on track by listening to motivational music
when I’m driving to the gym. I’ve been listening to a lot of Rob Bailey and
the Hustle Standard. Their songs resonate with me, especially “Beast” and
“What I Live For.” The lyrics about chasing dreams and building success brick
by brick keep pushing me forward.
FIND YOUR “ZONE” WITH MUSIC
I listen to a lot of music at the gym or on my drives. When you focus
on the lyrics, you can really understand the artist’s life, struggles, goals, and
Week 11 | 219
dreams. Sure, some music is dumb, loud, and annoying, but you can skip
those or make a playlist of songs you enjoy. Have a master playlist to keep
you motivated to work out. I still have playlists from 2007 back in my box-
ing and kickboxing days. Listening to them is like a time capsule, taking me
back to those training moments.
With only two weeks left, we know what to do: Hammer down and go
full throttle. No cheats. Put together your playlist if you’re going on a body-
building stage or start practicing poses for your photoshoot. Next week, we’ll
change up the master plan and strategize for the final week of show prep.
Action Steps

THE FINAL PUSH
Congratulations on making it to Week 12. Most people will have quit
after Week 2. The writing was on the wall for them. There are no
shortcuts in this book.
LOSE THE WEIGHT IN AS LITTLE AS TWO DAYS
During my powerlifting days, I needed to drop 28lbs in three days to
compete in the 198lbs class. I achieved this by doing three to four cardio ses-
sions daily, wearing a makeshift sauna suit with garbage bags under layers
of sweatpants. For two days, I only had an apple and one egg white. I lost
the weight and competed well. It was a eureka moment, when I realized that
despite advising against “wrestler” diets, they worked.
Would I do that crash diet again? No. But it was a great learning expe-
rience. The difference back then? I was chasing a number. When chasing a
number, you can get there with a few hard days or weeks of grit. Need to
lose that last 10lbs? Sweat more and drink less water! I don’t recommend it,
but it’s possible. These days, I’m chasing a look and good health. This last
week won’t be the norm for dieting, but the past 11 weeks have been health-
ier. Chasing a number can drop pounds quickly. You’ll look the same, but
just be lighter. To get the “onstage” look, you need at least 12 weeks to recon-
dition and transform your body.
224 | STRONG AGAIN
LEARN ABOUT YOUR BODY, LEARN ABOUT HEALTH
By now, you may be asking yourself, How is a bodybuilding diet the best
option for my health? One of the first things doctors or dieticians recommend
when starting a healthy lifestyle is to eat whole foods. We covered that in the
first four weeks. That micro cycle eliminated garbage foods like cookies, your
kids’ leftovers, and snacks you eat when bored. You wrote everything down
and kept yourself accountable with healthy, whole foods. As you recall, I do
eat a lot of protein bars for convenience and to save time. To be honest, it is
out of laziness too. I don’t prepare as well as I should, so I just hit the easy
button. The first four weeks of this program are all about shifting your focus
and mindset.
The second micro cycle focused on a protein-centric diet, still eating healthy
whole foods and allowing a carb-load day once a week. Your carb-load day
may have been different to mine, but fueling up those muscles on that one
day would have felt amazing if you were strict with protein for the rest of the
week. Your body was starving for those carbs.
The final phase and third micro cycle has restricted carbohydrates to those
from vegetables, meal replacements, or protein powders usually. I would be
lying if I said I didn’t have any popcorn with the kids during this phase, but
the mindset is so different that I am able to control my consumption. Things
that keep me going during this phase are vegetables dipped in salsa and plain,
non-fat Greek yogurt. This helps trick my mind.
These three weeks of strict carbohydrate load are the final push for the
show. I have been listening to a book on insulin sensitivity called Why We Get
Sick (Nesse & Williams, 1995) to get me through this time. It’s prompted a
few lightbulb moments about keeping my insulin regulated while on a body-
building diet.
This type of diet is not only going to make you look like a statue chiseled
by Michelangelo himself, it also checks all the boxes for a healthier lifestyle.
Week 12 | 225
It was an easy transition for me as I gave up sugar more than a year ago, so
the only big change was adding more protein to bring my calories up and
the final push for the last four weeks.
HYDRATION STRATEGY
Drinking water is key to staying hydrated. Not only straight water, but water
containing vitamins and minerals. You need some type of carbohydrate to
drive that water into your cells, and that is why a low-sweetened add-in is
better than just drinking two or three gallons of plain water each day. When
we sweat, we lose electrolytes. These minerals keep our heart pumping and
cells working properly. To optimize the return of electrolytes to my cells dur-
ing or after hard workouts, I always use a rehydration add-in called Rehy-
drate. I can do plain water for a few quarts, but then I need something else.
And this week we start by focusing on flushing our system with water to trick
it later in the week.
DRINK WATER, ADD ELECTROLYTES
Starting on a Sunday, I drink about two gallons of water. I always have a
gallon jug with me, along with a 32oz bottle in which I mix my Spark and
Rehydrate four or five times a day. This adds up to well over two gallons. Like
with a diet, there’s some wiggle room in the master plan to drink a full gallon
each day, so long as you don’t drink much less. With working out and need-
ing that pick-me-up in the morning with my Spark, I am usually half a gal-
lon into my fluid consumption by 4 am.
What I love about Spark is that it gives me a steady stream of energy and
vitamins. You do not have that crash afterwards and the taste is amazing.
Also, it is my wife’s direct sales business, and we always support each other
(AdvoCare, n.d.). You will find her email if you want to contact her about
coaching and a roadmap for your healthy eating and supplementation at
226 | STRONG AGAIN
www.advocare.com/11057354. She is more compassionate than me when it
comes to helping people out with the diet. As you will know from reading
this book, I will tell you how to do it and allow a little wiggle room. If you
cannot focus for 12 weeks to really learn about diet and nutrition, then that
is on you, and you need to keep hanging out with your friends who tell you
that you look great.
AVOID SUGARY DRINKS,
BUT DRINK WHAT TASTES GOOD
The liquid in my gallon jug usually looks like urine because I add Mio,
with lemonade being my favorite flavor. This helps me easily consume an extra
gallon of water each day. Sundays are usually my least active days, making it
hard to drink that much water.
On Mondays, I try to consume the extra gallon by noon so I can refill it
and work on another. The goal for Monday and Tuesday is to drink two to
three gallons of water. You’ll be hitting the bathroom more often, so know
where they are at each store you visit. A protein-only diet and lots of water
means you’ll always need to have a bathroom nearby.
The only carbs we should consume this week are vegetables, just like the
past three weeks. This week is crucial, and if you still feel fleshy at Week 9 or
10, it’s a good time to be stricter with yourself. I often do this. It’s a fine line
calorie-wise because you don’t want to get too low; remember, we’re not try-
ing to lose weight, just fat.
The goal of the hydration process is to get our bodies used to drinking
all this water and making our cells feel happy. It’s like our cells are throw-
ing a party, getting so much water that they start believing the well will
never run dry. Your high-protein diet makes you pee all the time because
the limited carbohydrates can’t get into your cells, so the excess water is
flushed out.
Week 12 | 227
KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOMS ARE
Wednesday is the time to consume a gallon to a gallon and a half. There is
no need to push it that hard, but since we had two to three gallons the other
two days, you may feel like you are thirstier today. In the past, I would half
my water on Wednesday, and then half it again on Thursday. By Friday, you
have dehydrated your muscles by tricking your cells into thinking they are
getting lots of water, then doing a hard stop. Your cells continue to let go of
water thinking the well will not dry up, but then it does. Here is an example
of what I have found to be successful in the past, as long as I put the hard
work in over the previous weeks.
• Sunday: an extra gallon of water
• Monday: one to two extra gallons of water
• Tuesday: one to two extra gallons of water
• Wednesday: an extra gallon of water
• Thursday: an extra half a gallon of water
• Friday: zero fluids
I followed this exactly at my last show to get back on stage for Saturday.
With the carbohydrates I was consuming Friday and Saturday, I thought I
looked good. I was proud of what I accomplished. Listening to others back-
stage and their preparation for the show, something dawned on me after it
finished. I awoke Sunday morning feeling shredded beyond belief to where
my skin felt like it was stretched to bursting with muscle.
Rewind to Saturday backstage, guys in there said their coaches had them
eat a pound of beef and drink a gallon of water the night before the show. I
have never heard that before, but more than one person was saying that. I
228 | STRONG AGAIN
have heard of adding carbohydrates but more in small quantities to avoid
spill over.
ALWAYS LEARNING, ALWAYS REFINING
After the show, my wife and I went out to dinner and I had an eight-ounce
steak, some sweet potato fries, and about three waters and six diet cokes. I
was thirsty after almost two days of dehydrating. When you trick your body
into thinking it has all this water coming into it and your cells start dump-
ing water, you can easily force yourself to dehydrate. The only way for a car-
bohydrate to get into your cells is to have water with it. For every one gram
of carbohydrate you consume, four grams of water go with it. The first time
I heard that was back in graduate school from a nutrition coach who came
and measured all the kids’ body fat and gave talks on healthy eating for sports
performance during college.
This was my eureka moment. For the first time, I didn’t go bonkers after
my pre-judging show and my night show, and I stayed consistent with not
that much fluid. So, I basically dehydrated for almost two days and then had
that steak, some carbs, and water like these guys backstage were talking about.
It was a radical shift from going into the show and doing what I always do:
zero water, some carbs every few hours. My skin, my muscles, my veins felt
way more pumped after having dehydrated for two days and then eating the
beef and drinking water the night before. This is why I weighed in at 197lbs
on Saturday morning and then on the same scales weighed 215lbs Monday
morning. Is that going to make or break a first place for me? No. The fasci-
nating part was it worked, and I can improve with this strategy.
DON’T JUST DO THE SAME THING YOU HAVE
ALWAYS DONE IF YOU WANT A DIFFERENT RESULT
Week 12 | 229
From Sunday through Wednesday, I’ll be drinking two gallons of extra
water each day. I’ll stop fluids and start the dehydration process after my Spark
for my Thursday morning workout. I will check my weight at the gym to see
how my body responds when I step on stage. The foods for Thursday and
Friday will be similar to an Atkins or keto diet with minimal carbs. The goal
is to eliminate water from my system. This is probably the unhealthiest part
of the 12-week diet. It’s funny when I explain a bodybuilding diet to people:
I can talk about the hard workouts, the 12 weeks, the early mornings, and
the food cravings, but people often think I looked good on stage because of
the dehydration strategy. Like the wrestler diet, you can dehydrate for two
days and drop all that weight, but you’ll look the same, just lighter. It doesn’t
showcase the hard work of body transformation.
ALL YOU DO IS NOT DRINK WATER?
The new strategy for this diet will start in a similar way to what I have
done in the past. The only exception will be to not half my water on Wednes-
day and Thursday, but completely shut it down starting Thursday mid-morn-
ing. Following the advice from multiple competitors backstage and seeing
the results myself from the day-after phenomenon of bodybuilding, I will
eat a nice big steak, sweet potato, and half a gallon of water the night before
I go on stage. I may still eat some carbs throughout the day to avoid what is
called “carb spillage.” That is a term used to explain that your cells can only
handle so many carbohydrates. If you ingest too many, you’re “bursting” your
cells with inflammation and then you will end up looking “watery” and “flat”
onstage. It’s usually the opposite effect for me because I am so afraid of look-
ing like that, I limit the amount of carbs I eat. Fridays in the past, I would
eat about half a cup of oatmeal with protein in it every three hours starting
around 3 pm. I just don’t think it filled me up enough onstage compared
to this past show. When in doubt, I think I would rather look “skinny” and
230 | STRONG AGAIN
shredded than flat, so it is a fine line that you don’t want to mess up after 12
weeks of hard training.
• Sunday-Wednesday: two or more gallons of water a day
• Thursday: 24oz fluid in the morning, then no more
• Friday: zero fluids all day until nighttime if you can tolerate it, then
half a gallon at least of water and eight to 16oz of ground beef or
steak and one or two cups of sweet potato
MENTAL PREPARATION
This last week many people will not understand how long and hard you have
worked. Your farts will smell of broccoli and rotten eggs. But fear not, as
everyone understands the hard work when you lift your shirt and flex the six-
pack. Some people will praise your hard work, but you will also hear com-
ments like, “I can’t wait until the old person is back.” And, to some extent,
it will feel good to just grab a cookie in celebration of someone’s birthday, or
to put that creamer in your coffee again. But we need to relish the sacrifice
we made for the past 12 weeks, and know that it was worth it.
LIKE PIECES OF A PUZZLE, YOU WILL
START TO FIT EVERYTHING TOGETHER
AND SEE THE BIG PICTURE ON HEALTH
You’ve learned so much about your body, and you’ll realize that everyone
is carb sensitive, mainly because our Western diet focuses heavily on carbo-
hydrates. Breakfast cereals claiming to be healthy are often just starches, sug-
ars, and carbs. This last week is probably the easiest of the whole diet because
you know it’s the end, and it’s very different from the previous weeks. Focus-
ing on water control and protein takes your mind off hunger, making it easier
Week 12 | 231
to ignore donuts and junk food. You’ve endured for 11 weeks; this last week
is the icing on the cake.
You’ll still be practicing your posing, working out hard, and refining your
playlist in the week leading up to the competition. Enjoy your last week
because Friday will be a day of spray tans, meetings, and living on cloud nine.
Saturday will feel like a whirlwind. You will be nervous onstage and may miss
a few steps or moves, but remember at local shows most people are doing it
for the first time and everyone is there to have fun. It was a great feeling to
be back on stage after a 12-year hiatus, and the smell of tanning solution and
listening to backstage conversations brought me back to my more youthful
days 20 years ago when Ronnie Coleman was backstage as a guest poser at
my first competition.
PERSISTENCE AND CONSISTENCY
ALWAYS COME OUT ON TOP
This is a stage of hard work and determination as much as top perfor-
mance. It is a battle of your will, and anyone can win that battle. Most of your
focus should be on the diet. Everyone is looking for that magic bullet, but
you will never reach the pinnacle of your potential unless you put the time
in and push forward. You may lose friends for the time being, but they will
be back. Or better yet, you will gain the respect of a bunch of new friends
who believe in you and themselves.
It’s amazing to help others reach their goals, and even more amazing when
they tell you that you inspired them without you knowing they wanted that
change. They were like me, eavesdropping backstage on diet strategies, lis-
tening to you talk to others about your diet and what you were doing. They
took your advice and ran with it.
Enjoy the show: You have earned the respect from everyone around you,
now just have fun with it.

Epilogue
Ijust have to say again, congratulations on your incredible achievement!
Getting on stage or reaching your weight goal is no small feat, and you
should take the time to relish that victory. It’s a testament to your hard
work, dedication, and mental fortitude.
Back in college when we played football on Saturdays, win or lose, we par-
tied and celebrated all weekend. Come Monday, it was always a fresh start,
a blank slate to refocus and set new goals. It’s important to switch mind-
sets now and look ahead with the same determination and clarity you had
during your prep. Embrace this new week as an opportunity to chase after
another goal, knowing that with the same spirit, you can achieve anything
you set your mind to.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expect-
ing a different result. This time, I tried something new with my hydration strat-
egy and carb loading. Unfortunately, it didn’t work as well as expected because
I don’t think I was dry enough by Friday night. Unlike the show four months
earlier, I was not disciplined enough. I never felt quite ready, and using my
caliper to pinch my belly fat, I realized I wasn’t reaching my goal. Hindsight is
always 20/20, and I should have just kept dehydrating instead of trying to fill
up with carbs the night before. Either way, I’m proud of doing the show. Todd
and I went out for burgers and a Bavarian pretzel afterward, where I devoured
most of the pretzel and, once again, ate way too much for my little stomach.
234 | STRONG AGAIN
I had a couple of friends come to the show to support me and Todd onstage.
I was able to get Ronnie Coleman’s autograph on a picture I printed out of
us from 20 years ago. He also took a sample of my book to read and put it in
his briefcase. Whether he reads it or not, it was still pretty cool that he took
it and said he would like to read it.
My song was a bit slow for my posing routine. I chose a country song
crafted and performed by a Nashville songwriter, detailing how my wife and
I met. I guess I’m a hopeless romantic. Todd ended up placing in the top
five of his classic physique category but pulled a back muscle while hitting a
pose in his nighttime routine. He scratched his next physique class and was
done for the night. We both had incredible, hard-fought journeys through
this process and are glad to be finished, but we have the tenacity and drive
to do another one—just not anytime soon.
As you reach the end of this 12-week bodybuilding journey, remember
that this is just the beginning. The discipline, dedication, and resilience you’ve
developed will serve you well beyond the gym. Embrace the lessons learned,
celebrate your progress, and continue to strive for excellence in all areas of
your life. Your transformation is a testament to what can be achieved with
unwavering commitment and a positive mindset. Keep pushing your limits,
stay focused on your goals, and inspire others with your journey. Here’s to a
healthier, stronger, and more empowered you!
Keep building. Keep striving. Stay strong.
