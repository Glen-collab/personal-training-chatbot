Small, manageable goals prevent burnout - like Glen's early goal of 12-inch biceps inspired by Arnold. Break weight loss into achievable steps. Specific means knowing exactly what you want, measurable allows progress tracking, achievable ensures realistic targets within 12 weeks."

Track seven meals daily, targeting ~2,800 calories with protein focus. Small deviations like swapping eggs for egg whites can reduce calories significantly. The plan uses a 40-40-20 (protein-carb-fat) ratio targeting your BMR for fat loss."

          "topic": "Protein as King",
          "response": "Aim for 1g protein per pound of bodyweight. Protein builds muscle, boosts metabolism, and burns calories via thermogenic effect. Glen's blood tests confirmed this is safe, supporting muscle repair and weight loss without kidney harm. Protein curbs hunger, preventing blood sugar crashes. You can't get fat on protein - use it to manage hunger and support weight loss."

Glen's program focuses on protein-rich foods for fat loss, not processed items. Use protein bars, shakes, and jerky for busy lifestyles, preventing skipped meals. Consistency beats perfection."

Choose low-sugar carbs like popcorn, rice, or sweet potatoes. Control carbs to sustain fat loss beyond initial water weight drop. Initial weight loss is water weight from cutting carbs, which store water and cause inflammation."

Friday: zero fluids until evening, then 0.5 gallon with 8-16oz steak and 1-2 cups sweet potato. This creates dramatic conditioning by forcing dehydration while cells keep releasing water."

          "response": "Creatine is one of the most well-researched supplements available and widely regarded as safe. Glen started using it in seventh grade. Even if physical effects were minimal early on, it motivated harder training. Use supplements like protein powders, BCAAs, and multivitamins to fill nutritional gaps during intense training."

          "topic": "Carb Cycling for Fat Loss",
          "response": "Carb cycling alternates high- and low-carb days to boost fat loss and muscle growth. Plan high-carb days (sushi, bagels) around workouts for energy. Low-carb days with lean proteins like chicken breast and egg whites ramp up fat burning. High insulin sensitivity aids carb absorption; low sensitivity stores fat."

Stick with enjoyable exercises like weight training to stay consistent."

          "topic": "Weight Training vs Cardio for Fat Loss",
          "response": "Glen's program prioritizes weight training over cardio for fat loss. Cardio benefits heart health but isn't ideal for fat loss alone. Use weight training and HIIT to build muscle and burn fat effectively. HIIT boosts fat burning but is mentally tough - balance it with weight training for sustainable results."

Working with elite Division 1 athletes as they transitioned from D2 to D1 under Coach Bohl taught me advanced periodization and Olympic lifting techniques.

He served 12 years in Combat Control with the United States Air Force special forces, where fitness was the foundation of his skills and survival.

But more importantly, she keeps crushing huge goals. She's now a Black Hawk helicopter pilot who just got assigned to the 160th Airborne flying elite missions. Watching someone grow from a 12-year-old athlete to flying special operations reminds me that building character early creates unstoppable adults."

Both went on to become Division 1 players and good men on and off the field. Now I have many 8th graders benching over 225lbs and feeling confident.
