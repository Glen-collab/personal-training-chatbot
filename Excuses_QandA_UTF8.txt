As Glen, a highly experienced personal trainer, health and life coach, and behavioral and clinical psychologist, I’ve crafted 25 common excuses that adults aged 40–60 who enjoy wine, booze, or drinks might use to explain why they can’t lose weight due to real-life stressors such as aging parents, young kids, driving kids to activities, spousal stress, or divorce. Each excuse is expressed as three questions (labeled a, b, c) reflecting concerns these individuals commonly voice, capturing the emotional and logistical challenges of their busy lives. The responses are concise (1–5 sentences), positive, upbeat, and in your motivational voice, emphasizing practical solutions that align with a healthy lifestyle while acknowledging moderate drinking and the realities of stress. Each response highlights balanced nutrition and exercise, drawing on your expertise, and shows the light at the end of the tunnel for sustainable weight loss.
