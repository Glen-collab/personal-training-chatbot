ABSTRACT
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) predicts that planned behaviors are determined
by behavioral intentions which are largely influenced by an individual’s attitude toward a
behavior, the subjective norms encasing the execution of the behavior, and the
individual’s perception of their control over the behavior (Ajzen, 1975). Ajzen’s theory
has been used to predict an array of behaviors (Martin et al., 2010; Quine & Rubin,
1997; Stone, Jawahar, & Kisamore, 2010). Social networking sites are defined as online
products such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, or other websites focused on maintaining
and/or building relationships. The current study surveyed 221 participants about their
use of these sites and projected assistance offered to others with social networking
among hypothetical friends and relatives at ages: 20, 40 and 60 years. Participants' age
varied from 18 to 27 years or older (M = 20.37) and was comprised of 71 males, 148
females. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the TPB in predicting
students’ use of social networking sites (SNS). Hypotheses were: (1) factor analysis will
show that items for each of the TPB’s components will correlate with the other items
within the same component and (2) the factor analysis will lead to a regression model
showing that SNS use conforms to Ajzen’s model. Results showed that Ajzen’s model was
not supported. Factor Analysis showed that Intention and Behavior factors were highly
correlated and not separate factors. These findings suggest that the TPB does not predict
routinized SNS use behaviors; other studies reported either novel behaviors (Quine &
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 2
Rubin, 1997) or the cessation of addictive behaviors (Hoie, Moan, & Rise, 2009).
Although the age demographic above 50 years is the fastest growing SNS user age
(Madden, 2010), our results showed possible age stereotyping in assisting older
individuals in the use of SNS.

INTRODUCTION
Ajzen (1991) proposed the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) wherein the
individual’s behavior is best predicted by one’s intentions; intentions are, in turn,
predicted by attitudes about the behavior, the subjective norms (a person’s perception of
important others’ beliefs that he or she should or should not perform the behavior)
encasing the execution of the behavior, and the individual’s perception of their control
over the behavior Ajzen’s TPB has been used to predict many different behaviors ranging
from gambling behaviors to the use of hormone replacement therapy. Stone, Jawahar, and
Kisamore (2010) conducted a study in Oklahoma which studied the Theory of Planned
Behavior predicting academic misconduct intentions and behavior. They studied the
cheating intentions and behavior of a sample of 241 business undergraduates. They found
that the TPB accounted for 21% of the variance in cheating intentions and 36% of
cheating behavior. The finding of their study was that the TPB model is a valuable tool
for predicting cheating behaviors and could further research on academic misconduct.
Robinson and Doverspike (2006) applied the Theory of Planned Behavior to
individuals’ intentions to enroll in either an online version or a traditional classroom
version of an experimental psychology class. A sample of 112 psychology majors, ages
ranging from 18 to 51 years old, completed a questionnaire which included a fabricated
description of an experimental psychology course at the university. The questionnaire
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 3
measured each of the components of Ajzen’s theory. General attitudes and subjective
norms directly predicted intentions to register for an online course.
Women’s intentions to receive hormone replacement therapy were measured using
Ajzen’s theory in a study performed at the Center for Research in Health in Canterbury,
England. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of women, aged 38 to 58 years
old, found in the Kent Family Health Services Authority records. This questionnaire was
designed to measure each component of the Theory of Planned Behavior. A hierarchical
multiple regression analysis was done and showed that past behaviors were shown to
induce behavior through attitude and perceived behavioral control. They also found that
the beliefs of their loved ones, their perceived behavioral control, and their personal
beliefs were all important in predicting their intention to receive hormone replacement
therapy (Quine & Rubin, 1997).
The Theory of Planned Behavior has also been used to predict gambling
behaviors. A survey was given to 80 college students which attempted to assess the utility
of Ajzen’s theory in predicting gambling behavior and frequency. The results of this study
support the efficacy of using this theory to clarify gambling behavior in this population.
They found that perceived behavioral control and subjective norms predicted past
gambling, and subjective norms, attitudes and perceived behavioral control predicted the
frequency of gambling behaviors (Martin et al., 2010).
Hoie, Moan and Rise (2009) did a study which supported the TPB in the context
of the intention to quit smoking. They hypothesized that the predictive utility of the TPB
model on intentions would be enhanced by past experiences with the behavior. The
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 4
Theory of Planned Behavior components accounted for 12.3% of variance in the
intention of quitting with the strongest impact coming from past behaviors.
Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior was recently applied to social networking.
Baker and White (2010) conducted a study examining the use of the Theory of Planned
Behavior to predict adolescents’ use of social networking. A questionnaire was given to
160 students that measured the components of Ajzen’s theory and then they were asked to
return a week later to report their social networking site use in the preceding week. Their
study found support for the TPB’s components of attitude, perceived behavioral control,
and group norms in predicting intentions to use social networking sites. They then found
support that intentions predict behavior.
The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Theory of Planned
Behavior in predicting college students’ use of social networking sites (SNS). Social
networking sites are defined as online products such as Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, or
other websites which focus on maintaining and/or building relationships. The hypothesis
was that a factor analysis will show that items for each of TPB’s components will
correlate within the component and the factor analysis will lead to a regression model
showing that SNS use as a planned behavior conforms to Ajzen’s model.
METHOD
Participants
Approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB EXP2010T1845) was
obtained prior to conducting the study. There were 221 participants (71 men and 148
women) along with two participants who did not report their gender. The ages of the
participants ranged from 18 to 27 or older, with a mean of 20.37 years; five participants
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 5
did not report their age. Participants had the following ethnicities: 131 were Caucasian, 3
were Native American, 9 were African-American, 3 were Asian, 49 were Latino, 16 were
multi-racial, 4 identified themselves as other, and 6 preferred not to answer. Participants
were compensated by receiving extra credit in their Human Sexuality class.
Materials and Procedure
The participants were given one of two different packets, each with a different
form number and corresponding packet color. Participants were told to complete the
entire questionnaire provided to them even if they did not use social networking sites.
Participants were provided no identifying information; their responses were anonymous.
The first section was comprised of biographical items. Responses to all
subsequent items were based on a 10-point scale, ranging from low (1) to high (10).
Items about social networking are shown in Appendixes A and B, there were 4-5 items for
each category: (a) participants’ estimates of their own social networks’ use of social
networking e.g., the participant, relatives’ and friends (Use); (b) estimates of how much
the participant helped their peers/relatives use social networking (Help); (c) attitudes
about use of social media (Attitude); (d) participant’s perception of important others’
beliefs that he or she should or should not perform the behavior (Subjective Norms); (e)
participant’s perceived ease or difficulty of performing a particular behavior (Perceived
Behavioral Control); (f) intentions to use social networks in the future (Intention) and (g)
participant’s reported behaviors related to the use of social media (Behavior).
RESULTS
A factor analysis was performed to determine whether the data for Attitudes,
Social Norms, Perceived Behavioral Control, Intention and Behavior conformed to
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 6
Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior. A varimax, non-forced factor analysis with a cut-off
point of .400 did not show factors consistent with Ajzen's theory. The factor analysis
showed that 4 Intention and 5 Behavior items loaded in the same factor. All of the
Attitudes items and one Intention item comprised the second factor. All five of the
Perceived Behavior Control items loaded in the same factor. The Social Norms items
were all in the same factor as well. The pattern matrix for the factor analysis is shown in
Table 1.
DISCUSSION
Intentions were not significantly predicted by Attitudes, Subjective Norms, and
Perceived Behavioral Control. Intentions were grouped with the Behaviors in the factor
analysis; in Ajzen’s theory Intentions and Behaviors should be separate factors so this
hindered further analysis; perhaps an outcome resulting from the Behaviors being
reported at the same time as the Intentions. The participants did not have time to make
their actual Behaviors different from their Intentions. Therefore, Intention and Behavior
scores were too similar to test Ajzen’s model. Other studies which have found support for
Ajzen’s theory examined activities which an individual planned to do or planned to stop
doing. In this study participants were asked to plan an activity in which they were already
engaged, which may have made it difficult to differentiate the Intention from the
Behavior responses. In the past, the TPB has been criticized due to the lack of a prior
experience component. For example, in a study performed by Bentler and Speckart
(1979) it was determined that factors other than intentions were more important in
predicting behavior. Perhaps our study would have supported Ajzen’s theory if there was
a component consisting of the participants’ prior experience included in the model.
AJZEN’S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL MEDIA 7
By contrast, the participants in the Baker and White (2010) study were asked to
report their behavior a week later, thus giving the respondents time to differentiate their
intentions from their behavior. This is a large difference between the current study and
Baker and White’s study, and could account for Ajzen’s model being supported in one
study but not in the other.
In future investigations, behaviors should be measured at a later time than the
other components of Ajzen’s theory. Even though the routinization of social networking
is an important aspect of our results, the instant feedback on behavior may have impacted
the results in our study. Also, a more accurate measure of estimated Time required would
be advantageous to avoid any problems associated with the varied perception of time.
Further studies could incorporate lab observations to investigate the Success and Time
required facilitating another’s SNS use. This could show how a participant’s perception
could affect their estimates of Success and Time required facilitating SNS use.
