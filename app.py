        ### üî• **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**
        Your BMR is the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive - breathing, heart beating, brain functioning, cell repair. Think of it as your body's "idle speed."
        
        **Glen's take:** "Even if you laid in bed all day, you'd still burn your BMR calories. It's usually 60-70% of your total daily burn. This is why crash diets are stupid - you can't go below your BMR for long without your body fighting back."
        
        ### ‚ö° **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**
        Your TDEE is your BMR PLUS all the calories you burn through activity - walking, working out, even fidgeting. This is your true daily calorie burn.
        
        **Glen's experience:** "After 25+ years of coaching, I've learned that most people underestimate their activity level. Be honest about your real lifestyle, not what you wish it was. That's how you get accurate numbers that actually work."
        
        ### üéØ **Why This Matters for Weight Loss**
        - **Eat above TDEE = Weight gain**
        - **Eat at TDEE = Weight maintenance** 
        - **Eat below TDEE = Weight loss**
        
        **My recommendation:** Start 500 calories below your TDEE for steady 1 lb/week loss. It's sustainable and you won't feel like you're starving.

        ‚Ä¢ **{results['protein_grams']}g protein** (non-negotiable!)

        ‚Ä¢ **{round(results['weight_loss'] * 0.25 / 9)}g healthy fats** (for hormones)
        
        **üìà Tracking Tips:**
        ‚Ä¢ Weigh yourself same day/time weekly
        ‚Ä¢ Take progress photos every 2 weeks
        ‚Ä¢ Track food for first 2 weeks to learn portions
        ‚Ä¢ Adjust calories if no progress after 3 weeks
        
        **Glen's reality check:** "These numbers are your starting point. Every body responds differently. Give it 2-3 weeks, then adjust based on your results. I've been doing this for 25+ years - trust the process!"

**Why this works:**
‚Ä¢ **Carbs fuel performance**: They power your workouts and recovery.
‚Ä¢ **1.2g/lb is sustainable**: Enough for energy, not so much you store fat.
‚Ä¢ **Adjust based on goals**:
  - **Weight loss**: Stick to {carb_grams - 20}-{carb_grams}g, prioritize veggies.
  - **Muscle gain**: Bump to {carb_grams + 20}-{carb_grams + 50}g, add starches.
  - **Maintenance**: Stay at {carb_grams}g.

**Best carb sources:**
‚Ä¢ **Oats**: 25g carbs per 1/2 cup (pre-workout energy)
‚Ä¢ **Sweet potatoes**: 26g per medium potato (steady energy)
‚Ä¢ **Brown rice**: 45g per cup (post-workout recovery)
‚Ä¢ **Vegetables**: 5-10g per cup (micronutrients, low calorie)
‚Ä¢ **Fruit**: 15-20g per piece (natural sugars, vitamins)

**My experience:** After 25+ years, I‚Äôve seen clients thrive on this carb range. It‚Äôs enough to crush workouts without feeling sluggish or bloated. Low-carb fads can tank your energy‚Äîdon‚Äôt fall for it!

**Pro tip:** Time carbs around workouts‚Äî50% of daily carbs pre/post-workout for max performance.
