        ### üî• **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**
        Your BMR is the number of calories your body burns just to stay alive - breathing, heart beating, brain functioning, cell repair. Think of it as your body's "idle speed."
        
        **Glen's take:** "Even if you laid in bed all day, you'd still burn your BMR calories. It's usually 60-70% of your total daily burn. This is why crash diets are stupid - you can't go below your BMR for long without your body fighting back."
        
        ### ‚ö° **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**
        Your TDEE is your BMR PLUS all the calories you burn through activity - walking, working out, even fidgeting. This is your true daily calorie burn.
        
        **Glen's experience:** "After 25+ years of coaching, I've learned that most people underestimate their activity level. Be honest about your real lifestyle, not what you wish it was. That's how you get accurate numbers that actually work."
        
        ### üéØ **Why This Matters for Weight Loss**
        - **Eat above TDEE = Weight gain**
        - **Eat at TDEE = Weight maintenance** 
        - **Eat below TDEE = Weight loss**
        
        **My recommendation:** Start 500 calories below your TDEE for steady 1 lb/week loss. It's sustainable and you won't feel like you're starving.

‚Ä¢ Builds and maintains muscle
‚Ä¢ Boosts metabolism (burns calories to digest)
‚Ä¢ Keeps you full longer
‚Ä¢ Prevents blood sugar crashes

**Easy protein sources:**
‚Ä¢ **Chicken breast:** 25g per 4oz
‚Ä¢ **Eggs:** 6g per egg
‚Ä¢ **Greek yogurt:** 15-20g per cup
‚Ä¢ **Protein powder:** 20-30g per scoop
‚Ä¢ **Ground turkey:** 22g per 4oz

**My personal take:** I've had blood work done multiple times - high protein is safe and effective. Don't let anyone scare you away from adequate protein!

*This approach has worked for thousands of my clients over 25+ years.*"""

**If you weigh 200 pounds = 100 ounces (about 12 cups) daily**

**Simple hydration tips:**
‚Ä¢ **Start your day** with 16-20oz of water
‚Ä¢ **Drink before you're thirsty**
‚Ä¢ **More if you're active** or it's hot
‚Ä¢ **Monitor your urine** - light yellow is perfect

**What counts toward hydration:**
‚Ä¢ Plain water (best choice)
‚Ä¢ Herbal tea
‚Ä¢ Coffee (in moderation)
‚Ä¢ Water-rich foods (fruits, veggies)

**What doesn't help:**
‚Ä¢ Alcohol (actually dehydrates you)
‚Ä¢ High-sugar drinks
‚Ä¢ Excessive caffeine

*Good hydration supports everything - energy, recovery, fat loss, and performance!*"""

**For beginners:**
‚Ä¢ **3 days/week** - Perfect starting point
‚Ä¢ **Every other day** - Allows recovery
‚Ä¢ **Full body workouts** - Hit everything

**For experienced:**
‚Ä¢ **4-5 days/week** - Upper/lower splits work great
‚Ä¢ **Listen to your body** - Recovery is when you grow
‚Ä¢ **Quality over quantity** - 45 minutes beats 2 hours

**What matters most:**
‚Ä¢ **Show up consistently** (I train at 3:30am!)
‚Ä¢ **Progressive overload** - Gradually increase difficulty
‚Ä¢ **Compound movements** - Squats, deadlifts, rows
‚Ä¢ **Find exercises you enjoy** - You'll stick with them

**My reality check:** The best workout is the one you'll actually do. Start where you are, be consistent, and build from there.

*Consistency beats perfection every single time.*"""

    # Weight loss timeline
    if any(word in query_lower for word in ["lose weight", "weight loss", "how long", "how fast"]):
        return """**Realistic weight loss: 1-2 pounds per week.**

**My timeline expectations:**
‚Ä¢ **Week 1-2:** 3-5 pounds (mostly water weight)
‚Ä¢ **Week 3-12:** 1-2 pounds consistently
‚Ä¢ **12 weeks total:** 15-25 pounds realistically

**What affects your rate:**
‚Ä¢ **Starting weight** - Heavier people lose faster initially
‚Ä¢ **Age and gender** - Men typically lose faster
‚Ä¢ **Activity level** - More movement = faster results
‚Ä¢ **Consistency** - This is the biggest factor

**Glen's reality check:**
Don't chase the scale daily. Focus on:
‚Ä¢ **How your clothes fit**
‚Ä¢ **Energy levels**
‚Ä¢ **Strength improvements**
‚Ä¢ **Progress photos**

**Remember:** You didn't gain it overnight, you won't lose it overnight. But stick with my system for 12 weeks and you'll be amazed at the transformation!

    # Meal timing
    if any(word in query_lower for word in ["when to eat", "meal timing", "how often eat"]):

**Simple schedule that works:**
‚Ä¢ **Breakfast:** Within 1 hour of waking
‚Ä¢ **Lunch:** 4-5 hours later
‚Ä¢ **Dinner:** 4-5 hours after lunch
‚Ä¢ **Snacks:** If needed between meals

**What matters most:**
‚Ä¢ **Protein at every meal** - Non-negotiable
‚Ä¢ **Don't skip meals** - Leads to overeating later
‚Ä¢ **Last meal 2-3 hours before bed** - Better sleep
‚Ä¢ **Listen to your hunger** - Don't eat just because it's "time"

**My personal approach:**
I eat 3 main meals + 1-2 protein snacks. Keeps my energy steady and prevents those blood sugar crashes that lead to poor food choices.

**Bottom line:** Consistency with meal timing helps regulate your metabolism and prevents impulsive eating decisions.

*Find a schedule that fits your life and stick with it!*"""
