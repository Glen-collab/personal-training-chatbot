[TPB_WEIGHT_LOSS]
Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior shows weight loss depends on intentions, driven by attitudes (liking healthy habits), subjective norms (support from others), and perceived behavioral control (feeling capable). Stressors like caregiving or divorce can lower control and weaken intentions. Small steps like quick meals and AdvoCare Spark build confidence.
